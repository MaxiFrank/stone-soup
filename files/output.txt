With its \n', 'many unique natural features, it’s as impressive as any in the Pacific Northwest. \n', 'From its old growth trees. Winding footpaths. Expansive views of Puget Sound. \n', 'Sandy beaches dotted with glacial rocks and footprints.\n', 'It’s here, in this serene setting, that Jamie Margolin likes to connect with \n', 'nature, which she does often. But one day, when she was walking on the beach, she \n', 'saw a sign literally – that set her on her journey as a climate justice activist. “There \n', 'was a sign that read, ‘Please don’t feed the seal pups.’ I don’t know why, but the \n', 'message struck me as odd. In all the times I’d visited, I’d never seen any seal pups.” \n', 'Jamie knew something wasn’t adding up. But like the rest of her concerns \n', 'about the climate situation, she pushed it deep down. Hoping to forget, to move \n', 'on. So she kept walking. Further along the beach, another sign read, “These are \n', 'the whales and porpoises that you’ll commonly see around this bay.” \n', '“It was just like before. I’d never seen any whales or porpoises here. None of \n', 'my friends had either. That’s when I realized there’s a disconnect in our way of \n', 'thinking,” admits Jamie. “We see what we want to see, not what we need to see.”  \n', 'She continues, “Of course, these animals were here once, when the indigenous \n', 'peoples who cared for the land lived in this region. This really got me thinking \n', 'deeply about my own culture and the environment for the first time.”\n', 'Jamie might have become a devoted climate justice activist that day, at age \n', '14. But the groundwork for her activism had started long before that. Jamie’s \n', 'father is a bookish man, a Reform Jewish thinker who always listens to the news. \n', '“Politics is a constant in my life,” she says. “My dad is to thank for that. Believe it \n', 'or not, I didn’t grow up watching Hannah Montana. Nothing like that. For fun, we \n', 'watched The Colbert Report. Or The Daily Show. Or just the plain old news,” Jamie \n', 'says smiling.  “This really helped shape my perspective.” \n', ' 34\n', 'Jamie’s mother also had a huge impact on her world view. An immigrant \n', 'from Columbia, she had grown up in poverty with six siblings, and a single mother. \n', 'It was a tough life.  She instilled in Jamie a sense of caring about the world. Jamie \n', 'credits her own resilience to the lessons her mother taught her. “It’s what made \n', 'me the activist I am today.” \n', 'Next on a trip to Columbia to visit her cousins, Jamie had another formative \n', 'experience. Her family lives near a fracking site. There, she saw rivers with dead \n', 'fish in them, and polluted streams. In the city, she felt the burn of fossil fuels in \n', 'the air. She knew this sort of thing was happening in the United States. But she \n', 'didn’t know it was also happening in Columbia too. She started to see that the \n', 'environment was suffering everywhere. “And our leaders weren’t doing anything \n', 'about it,” she says. \n', 'When the night of the 2016 election came, everything changed for Jamie. “It \n', 'shattered my ideal, that the good guys would always win. I decided I wasn’t going \n', 'to rely on party leaders to make a difference. I was going to be the one that fought \n', 'for the good guys.”  That was the turning point that moved Jamie from thought \n', 'to action. \n', '“I started small,” explains Jamie.  “First, I got involved with Plant-for-the-\n', 'Planet—which was great introduction to the world of climate change advocacy. \n', 'After that, I started community organizing.  I talked to legislators and politicians, \n', 'and I helped put on lobbying events for environmental legislation, from Seattle \n', 'to Olympia.”  Jamie’s journey wasn’t always easy. Her rise to prominence wasn’t \n', 'always steady. Many times she met forceful resistance. \n', '“In January 2017, I had my first meeting with a Republican legislator. He \n', 'was quite hostile,” Jamie says. “The PTA was having a rally at the same time, so \n', 'it was very tense. When it came time for me to talk, the legislator cut me off and \n', 'said, ‘You see these people? They want money too.’ \n', '“He was not there to actually listen,” clarifies Jamie. “If he was, he would’ve \n', 'known that I wasn’t looking for money. Still, he carried on. He pulled out a bro-\n', 'chure on homelessness and said, ‘The money you want for climate justice could \n', 'be helping these kids.’\n', 'But this is all intersectional,  Jamie thought. How come he doesn’t understand? The \n', 'climate crisis makes homelessness worse. It’s not an isolated issue.  Jamie sighs. “I had many \n', 'experiences like this, where I was just shrugged off.”  What was even more frus-\n', 'trating is that there wasn’t a single media article about the fight for climate justice. \n', 'People weren’t paying attention. So Jamie decided, you know what? “Enough is \n', 'enough!”\n', '35\n', 'In July 2017, Jamie decided to start a National Youth Climate March to \n', 'really get people to listen. She was ready to grow from being a local organizer to \n', 'being the leader of an international movement.  Jamie posted her idea for the \n', 'March on social media, with an ambitious one-year timeline. At first slowly, then \n', 'rapidly, the number of people who signed up from around the country grew. One \n', 'year later, as promised - on July 21, 2018 - Jamie led the first Youth Climate March \n', 'in Washington, DC. Thousands of young people marched on the National Mall, \n', 'advocating for their right to a safe and livable future. Sister marches went on in \n', 'New York City, Indianapolis, Seattle, Las Vegas, and even in Melbourne, Austra-\n', 'lia, and London, U.K. Jamie was especially grateful that the march was endorsed \n', 'by such varying groups as the Peoples Climate Movement, The Climate Group, \n', 'Alliance for Climate Education, Citizens’ Climate Lobby, Indigenous Environ-\n', 'mental Network, Sierra Club, Sunrise, and the Women’s March Youth Empower.\n', 'By July 2019, Jamie’s efforts expanded in a big way. Then she upped her \n', 'game with the launch of Zero Hour. Its mission: to increase the voices of diverse \n', 'youth in the conversation around climate and environmental justice. She orga-\n', 'nized the first Youth Climate Summit, a three-day climate justice event in Miami, \n', 'Florida. All in all, the Summit trained more than 350 youth and older allies in \n', 'climate justice activism and organizing.  Jamie is supporting these newly trained \n', 'climate advocates to use Zero Hour’s Getting to the Roots of Climate Change \n', 'platform.  Now newly trained allies serve as ambassadors, and educate their local \n', 'communities about the climate movement. \n', 'For youth who want to get further involved in a community, Jamie’s message \n', 'is kind, and encouraging. “Growing up is hard,” she says. “Sometimes, it’s hard \n', 'to know your place in the world. So take something you are passionate about – \n', 'whether that is art, performing, cooking, or robotics – and apply that same passion \n', 'to a movement.”  \n', '“It doesn’t need to be climate justice,” she adds. “Just get involved, and get \n', 'informed. Use your skills and knowledge to create the change you want to see,” \n', 'she says adding,  “Never be afraid to use your voice. You are never too young, or \n', 'too weak.”  \n', 'According to Jamie, this is especially true for marginalized people, who are \n', 'not used to having their voices heard. “Young women. Women of color. Queer \n', 'people. It’s hard out there. So let’s use the tools we have to come together for \n', 'a common cause,” she explains. “Social media can bring us together like never \n', 'before,” she says.  “Zero Hour and the Youth Climate Movement wouldn’t have \n', 'been possible without it. You can change the world. We did!” \n', ' 36\n', 'For adults, Jamie’s advice is simple. “Stop pinning your responsibility on \n', 'children. The climate crisis can’t wait for my generation to fight it. By the time \n', 'I’m old enough to be in a position of power, it’ll be too late. The world will be on \n', 'fire. ‘Business as usual’ isn’t going to cut it this time. And words won’t either. We \n', 'need action. We need a major systems overhaul. And we need adults and children \n', 'working together towards that goal.” \n', 'Jamie pauses, and lets out a heavy sigh. After a silence, she continues, “You \n', 'need to be able to look your children in the eye and say, ‘I did all I could to protect \n', 'your future. I fought the battle against climate change. I turned over every stone I \n', 'possibly could.’ Adults need to ask themselves—and be honest—‘Have I done all \n', 'that I can for climate justice?’”\n', 'It’s a big ask. But according to Jamie, it’s a necessary one. “We can’t just \n', 'ignore it—and hope someone else will deal with it. Ensuring climate justice for \n', 'future generations is an enormous task. As a country, we must all come together. \n', 'As brothers and sisters together, we must have an answer to that big question. \n', '‘Have we done all that we can for climate justice?’” Jamie Margolin is counting on \n', 'everyone to stand up and be counted.\n', 'To cherish what remains of the Earth and  \n', 'to foster its renewal is our only legitimate \n', 'hope of survival.\n', 'Wendell Berry\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Join Zero Hour to demand climate action now! thisiszerohour.org \n', 'Buy Jamie’s book, Youth To Power at www.youthtopowerbook.com \n', 'Follow Jamie on Twitter @jamie_margolin\n', '37\n'], 'tags': [[35, 'air pollution fracking'], [37, 'Berry, Wendell'], [35, 'climate change intersectionality with human rights issues'], [36, 'climate change activism inclusivity in youth climate movement'], [36, 'climate change activism training youth'], [38, 'climate change activism training youth'], [36, 'climate justice diversity and inclusivity'], [36, 'diversity'], [35, 'fracking'], [35, 'intersectionality climate change and human rights'], [36, 'x communities'], [34, 'Margolin, Jamie'], [36, 'National Youth Climate March'], [35, 'Plant-for-the-Planet'], [36, 'social media as tool for activism'], [35, 'water pollution extractive industries'], [34, 'women and girls climate change activists'], [36, 'Youth Climate March'], [36, 'Youth Climate Summit'], [37, 'Youth To Power (Margolin)'], [36, 'Zero Hour']]}, '1': {'person': 'Alec Loorz', 'title': 'An Inconvenient Youth', 'start_page_number': '38', 'end_page_number': '41', 'story': ['An Inconvenient Youth\n', 'Alec Loorz | Olympia, Washington\n', 'Young Alec Loorz was awestruck when he found himself standing on a stage \n', 'with former Vice President Al Gore. “He told me he’d read my letter,” he says. \n', '“That day I felt like I was in a dreamworld, on stage with my hero.”\n', 'For Alec, watching An Inconvenient Truth when he was just 12 years old was a \n', 'turning point in his life. “It gave me that spark to really take action. Before that, I \n', 'was aware of climate change in a roundabout way. But that film made it real for \n', 'me. And I wanted to do something about it.”\n', 'When Al Gore’s documentary film, An Inconvenient Truth was released in 2006, \n', 'it created a renewed interest in the climate conversation globally – and that was \n', 'his goal. The conversation around the impending climate crisis had gone stale, \n', 'and needed to be reinvigorated. As a popular political figure, Gore knew he could \n', 'influence change. Alec was among the countless environmental advocates inspired \n', 'by the film, which to this day continues to create passionate climate activists.\n', 'From the moment Alec saw the film, he started spreading the word. Most \n', 'people Alec’s age weren’t aware of the climate movement. “I got into an argu-\n', 'ment with one of my friends about it,” he says, with a laugh. “Over time, I did a \n', 'lot of research on the issues, and my own story became intertwined. I felt a sense \n', 'of calling to be a part of the transition to a sustainable society.”\n', 'Alec learned a lot on his own. But he knew he needed to be around top \n', 'experts to really be able to make the wide-ranging impact he wanted to. So he de-\n', 'cided to go straight to the source of his inspiration. “Mr. Gore’s organization, the \n', 'Climate Reality Project, had a training program. However, they had an age cutoff, \n', 'and since I was only 13, I was turned down.” But Alec didn’t let that stop him; he \n', 'worked privately, behind the scenes. “I even sent a letter to Mr. Gore, saying how \n', 'I was rejected from the training, but I still wanted to be involved.”\n', 'Now, standing on the stage with his hero, Alec’s persistence had paid off. \n', ' 38\n', 'Mr. Gore told Alec that anybody with his passion should definitely be involved \n', 'in the cause. The very next week Alec got an invitation to join the next training \n', 'in Nashville, where he would become the youngest person ever trained. “That \n', 'was an unbelievable three days,” Alec says. At the end of the program, he was \n', 'equipped with a CD full of slides and directed to go out with it, into the world.\n', 'Alec had begun his environmental journey while still in middle school, by \n', 'founding Kids vs. Global Warming. He constructed signs throughout his coastal \n', 'city of Ventura, California, warning about the impacts of sea level rise. News of \n', 'his work began to leak out to the national press, and an intense public speaking \n', 'schedule emerged. All through high school Alec was a popular speaker: he gave \n', 'more than 1,000 presentations to over half a million people, most of them youth. \n', 'And he received prestigious awards, including the Coretta Scott King A.N.G.E.L. \n', 'Award, and the Brower Youth Award from the Earth Island Institute.\n', 'In 2010, at age 16, Alec cofounded iMatter with his mother, to support \n', 'youth-centered climate action. They held the first worldwide youth climate march \n', 'in 2011, with 45 countries participating. The same year, Alec and other iMatter \n', 'leaders acted as plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the U.S. federal government, on the \n', 'grounds that it has not lived up to its responsibility to protect the atmosphere for \n', 'future generations.\n', '“We actually made it all the way to U.S. federal court,” he says, proudly. “But \n', 'then the fossil fuel lobby got involved. They intervened in the case and sent some \n', 'really good lawyers, and they defeated it.” But, he adds, “The fact that they sent \n', 'their best lawyers to shut us down showed we were considered a serious threat \n', '–and we will continue to be. While we lost that lawsuit, this legal approach goes on \n', 'today. And will in the future.”\n', 'Alec continued to campaign. But he knew that the movement’s strategy \n', 'couldn’t be to just keep writing letters and having protests. “It felt like that famous \n', 'Einstein saying, like we were doing the same thing over and over again and ex-\n', 'pecting different results. I got frustrated. And so I decided to go out in search of \n', 'other perspectives.”\n', 'Alec visited Iceland, where he walked on a glacier that scientists say will \n', 'be gone in 100 years. He crossed the United States multiple times, visiting and \n', 'learning from organic farming coops that have a healthy relationship with the \n', 'land and their communities. He visited Indigenous people in Ecuador whose land \n', 'was threatened by extractive industry.\n', 'By 2017, Alec’s travels had led him to southeastern Utah. Here, at the Bears \n', 'Ears National Monument, he participated in a retreat as the Kalliopeia Founda-\n', '39\n', 'tion’s Spiritual Ecology Fellow.\n', 'Bears Ears is a national monument that was established in 2016 to protect \n', 'around 1.3 million acres from development. But in 2017, at the very time Alec \n', 'was on retreat there, a fateful announcement was made – the protected land area \n', 'was to be reduced by about 85 percent, to open up the lands to mining operations. \n', 'Simultaneously, nearly 900,000 acres was to be slashed from the Grand Stair-\n', 'case-Escalante Monument. Being there at the time, Alec had an insight.\n', '“If I try to identify what’s missing with the movement, it’s this core feature, \n', 'this idea of ‘us vs. them’. On one side, it’s the people trying to protect Bears Ears, \n', 'and on the other, it’s those who see the land as a resource to exploit. Yes, we have \n', 'differing viewpoints, and their actions can be damaging.” He pauses, then adds. \n', '“But I don’t think that the ‘us vs. them’ mentality will stop it. We’re all just people. \n', 'If we keep this kind of thinking up, we’ll just be repeating the same cycles of \n', 'division that got us standing on opposite sides of the issue in the first place. We’re \n', 'all together in this world, so we should come together and listen to one another. \n', 'It’s our only choice.”\n', 'Alec realized that in all his travels, whether he was in Iceland, the United \n', 'States, the Amazon or the Andes, there’s one tried and true method to bring \n', 'people together in their reverence for a land and its people – and that is through \n', 'telling stories. “My work has led me to the point where I think that telling stories \n', 'about places and people is the way forward. We can’t approach climate change \n', 'as this whole big abstract thing, where we’re saving the whole wide world. It’s too \n', 'broad. The only way to approach the depths of this, to really change how we live, \n', 'is to deep dive into specific spaces; and to explore the human relationship with \n', 'these spaces through storytelling.”\n', 'Now, through filmmaking, writing, and photography, Alec hopes to explore \n', 'new ways of telling stories that can address the depth and complexity of this \n', 'situation. Coupled with this change in his perspective, he also believes that more \n', 'people, including more young activists and advocates, need to actually get out into \n', 'the world and spend some significant time in nature, to gain a different perspec-\n', 'tive on what we really need to do to heal our planet.\n', '“Go outside—and keep going out,” he says. “This is not emphasized enough. \n', 'For anyone who wants to do this work, it’s going to be difficult. It’s emotional, and \n', 'at times even heart-wrenching. But it’s also freeing, to take a stand on behalf of \n', 'something bigger than yourself. We will lose ourselves if we don’t connect with the \n', 'places in our world that are real, and wild, and alive.”\n', 'Despite his struggles in coming to terms with what to do about such a big \n', ' 40\n', 'problem, Alec’s message to youth is one of hope. “The potential of young people \n', 'is greater than we realize,” he says. “Sometimes we tend to think, ‘We can try, but \n', 'we’re just kids, so no one will listen.’ But I’ve found the opposite to be true. There’s \n', 'something in young people standing up and doing what they feel is right that is \n', 'deeply powerful. We have this opportunity to come together in a new way. And to \n', 'create the future we want to grow up into.”\n', 'Alec’s story of coming of age in a time of radical transition can inspire \n', 'young people today.

She loves all animals, big or small. Her \n', 'favorites are snow leopards, blobfishes, and her pug puppy Mochi.\n', 'Lilly feels sad when she hears about whales dying. “When a whale eats plastic, \n', '41\n', 'it makes them feel full,” she explains. “So then they don’t want to eat food. And \n', 'they die.” She adds, “Whales are similar to humans, they’re intelligent and they \n', 'have a connection with nature. They have every single right to live on this planet.”\n', 'Lilly’s journey into environmental activism began with a walk she took with \n', 'her grandfather one day. When she was six years old, she moved with her family \n', 'from London to the Netherlands, to live on the edge of a beautiful green forest in \n', 'the city of Zeist. During that 20-minute walk, Lilly was shocked to see trash every-\n', 'where: on the road, in the fields, and thrown over the fence. “It was everywhere!” \n', 'she says. “At the time, I couldn’t really count in Dutch, so I practiced my Dutch \n', 'by counting all of these cans, bottles, and pieces of plastic. I counted 91 pieces! It \n', 'opened my mind. I realized there is just so much plastic in the world.”\n', 'And she decided then and there that she needed to do something about it.\n', 'A curious child, Lilly began by studying. She watched David Attenborough’s \n', 'documentaries, and listened to Jane Goodall’s speeches. She discovered that only \n', 'recently did plastics become popular, and now we are using 5 trillion plastic bags a \n', 'year. Since plastics are made out of fossil fuels, they are made to last. This means \n', 'that they are not biodegradable: the plastic just breaks down into smaller pieces \n', 'of plastic.\n', 'Lilly was disturbed to learn from her grandfather that any piece of plastic \n', 'that falls on the ground eventually makes its way into the ocean, through rivers \n', 'or other waterways. And from there it makes its way into a kind of plastic soup in \n', 'the ocean. In the Netherlands, rising sea levels threaten the nation’s very existence. \n', 'And with the Arctic ice melting, all of the plastic pieces from the earth are ending \n', 'up at the bottom of the sea.\n', 'The circle of life begins with plankton, the lowest form of life on the food \n', 'chain. The plankton eat microplastics, then smaller fish eat the plankton, then \n', 'larger fish eat the smaller fish, all the way up to the whales. When people eat fish \n', 'with plastic in their stomachs, the plastic gets inside of them too. “Once you know \n', 'this, you can never un-see that piece of plastic,” Lilly says. “When you pick up one \n', 'piece of plastic, you might actually be saving the life of an animal.”\n', 'To raise awareness, Lilly started picking up litter, and posting pictures of \n', 'the trash she had collected on her Facebook page. She organized cleanups in her \n', 'community, and recruited her friends to help. Together they picked up about 500 \n', 'pieces of plastic a week. Since she began, they’ve picked up nearly 200,000 pieces. \n', 'Each time Lilly takes a photo of the colored bottles, paper, and plastic, and posts it \n', 'before taking it to the recycling center. Lilly’s family then takes the broken electric \n', 'items to be mended at the repair cafes. The move to having a circular economy \n', ' 42\n', 'is very big there!\n', 'Lilly is also campaigning to stop litter at its source. She helped get her mu-\n', 'nicipality to join the Deposit Scheme Alliance for small bottles and cans. And she \n', 'is now raising awareness about the harmful effects of balloons. She hopes they \n', 'can be banned. “Have you ever seen the way animals suffer when they eat plastic?” \n', 'she asks, and adds, “One time we saw a picture of a baby puffin wrapped in \n', 'balloons, and it made me very cross.” So she and her mother spoke to the local car \n', 'dealer and convinced them to stop releasing balloons. And, as a youth ambassador \n', 'for the Plastic Pollution Coalition she speaks about the five Rs: recycle, renew, \n', 'reuse, refuse, and refill. “The refuse part inspired me to create a set of bamboo \n', 'straws,” she says.\n', 'After watching Greta Thunberg’s videos, Lilly was inspired to organize \n', 'school strikes to increase awareness of climate change. “At first lots of people \n', 'didn’t really know why I was doing it,” she says. “Then more people started to get \n', 'the message, and they started striking too.”\n', 'Lilly firmly believes that environmental issues must be taught in schools. “If \n', 'children learned about climate change, or about plastic pollution, and what they \n', 'can do to stop it, you could build a whole generation who actually care for the \n', 'environment instead of destroying it.”\n', 'When Indigenous people from the Amazon visited one of her school strikes, \n', 'they told her about the crisis in the rainforest.

I wondered, how can we \n', 'have such a huge problem, and no one is doing anything about it?” She turned \n', 'over the problem in her mind all night, and in the morning she went to school \n', 'ready to learn more about what she could do to solve it. But the next day, her class \n', 'was already moving on to another subject. “We were presented with the reality of \n', 'our dire situation, and just like that, that was the end of our climate education.”\n', 'But Iris wasn’t about to stop there: she wanted to find a way to make an \n', 'impact on this climate crisis outside of the classroom.\n', 'She began spending countless hours after school, educating herself on the \n', 'myriad issues related to climate justice. She devoured news articles, read scientific \n', 'papers, and perused social media for trending stories, so she could learn about \n', 'the people involved in fighting for climate justice, and the issues she needed to \n', 'understand. Over time, she became a self- taught expert on many environmental \n', 'issues–but she struggled with trying to figure out what to do with all of her knowl-\n', 'edge. “I was just a young girl trying to find a way to take on these gigantic issues,” \n', 'she says. “A lot of the time I felt really alone.”\n', 'The 2016 election was a turning point for Iris: she decided that no matter \n', 'how hard and long the journey for climate justice was, she was going to take up \n', 'the mantle for the youth of her generation. “The climate situation had become \n', 'so urgent that I realized I had to take the energy I was putting into pursuing my \n', 'environmental interests, and shift into action.”\n', 'Iris quickly realized that she couldn’t take on these massive environmental \n', 'problems alone. So she attended a local green festival that was being held near \n', 'her home in Howard County, Maryland, and she began networking with local \n', ' 46\n', 'environmental groups, clubs, associations, and grassroots organizations. This led \n', 'to some minor community organizing efforts with Less Plastic Please, Citizens’ \n', 'Climate Lobby, and the River Hill Watershed Committee.\n', 'It was a start, but Iris knew there was a bigger mission in store for her.\n', 'While organizing with these various communities, one thing stood out to \n', 'Iris—all of these groups were adult-led. There was little or no youth engagement \n', 'in Howard County on environmental issues. Through HoCo Climate Action, she \n', 'learned about the work of Jamie Margolin and Zero Hour, and she understood \n', 'her calling at once: she decided to begin organizing the youth of Howard County, \n', 'and to create a supportive community for dealing with issues of climate justice. \n', '“Learning about Jamie and what she was doing online—and with the Youth Cli-\n', 'mate March—was so inspiring,” she says. “There was nothing like that here.”\n', 'The fact that it was a young woman leading these events was inspirational for \n', 'Iris on a whole different level. “I said, you know what? If Jamie can get out there \n', 'and lead a climate march, why can’t I?”\n', 'And so she decided to take the lead. She started by creating Sunrise Move-\n', 'ment Howard County–a local chapter of the Sunrise Movement. Sunrise is a \n', 'national youth-led movement that supports the Green New Deal, and works to \n', 'make climate change a priority issue for legislation.\n', 'As an introvert, it wasn’t easy for Iris to be such a visible leader in this way, \n', 'but she knew it was something her community desperately needed. “To really \n', 'achieve change, we needed more people on board in my community. And we \n', 'needed the youth to be visible. Relying on adult-led organizations to bring young \n', 'people in was not going to be effective. These issues are going to affect the youth \n', 'the most, so I saw the importance of taking the initiative.”\n', 'Iris began leading climate marches, walkouts, strikes; and she lobbied fre-\n', 'quently in her hometown. She was so successful that she became a trainer for \n', 'Sunrise on a national level, educating other youth leaders around the country on \n', 'climate issues.\n', 'She also cofounded Fridays For Future Digital (FFFD), to expand digital \n', 'climate protests worldwide. “It started as just one sign each week, a sign that had \n', 'a message in support of climate justice. But the more people began to join the \n', 'movement, the more complex it became. Before we knew it, we were internation-\n', 'al. It was amazing!” She adds, “We wanted to take real digital actions to make \n', 'change, and we did. We’re proud of that.” To date, FFFD has partnered on digital \n', 'events with Polluters Out, Extinction Rebellion, and Re-Earth Initiative to bring \n', 'youth activists of all backgrounds together in support of climate justice for all.\n', '47\n', 'FFF Digital is now focused on increasing impact and accessibility in the \n', 'climate movement by providing local groups with the resources and skills they \n', 'need to create awesome digital campaigns. Through directly organizing with local \n', 'groups, they hope to bring new people into the movement, raise awareness of \n', 'climate justice and science issues, and put pressure on institutions to change.\n', 'Iris has been an effective youth organizer, but her success didn’t come easy. \n', 'There were lots of struggles along the way. She hopes to be able to provide some \n', 'guidance for youth who are just entering this space, so they know what they are up \n', 'against. “It’s important that other youth who want to get involved with cause-re-\n', 'lated work understand that adversity is part of the journey,” she says. “All you can \n', 'do is try to innovate, solve problems, and build communities along the way. And \n', 'when you get through to the other side—which you will—you will be glad you \n', 'took on the world.”\n', 'For youth leaders, peer pressure can be a tough issue to deal with. At the \n', 'onset of her journey, few of Iris’s peers understood what she was trying to do with \n', 'her climate justice activities. “I got a lot of criticism from the kids at my school \n', 'who didn’t get what climate justice was all about. Sometimes I even heard mum-\n', 'blings from the adults. I definitely didn’t get the support I thought I would. But \n', 'once you grow a little, you will see that those jeers are so small when compared to \n', 'the scale of the climate crisis.”\n', 'Working heavily in the digital arena, there are also some bullying issues that \n', 'Iris has had to learn how to deal with. “The biggest issue climate activists face on-\n', 'line are the trolls. Insults about your looks. Your race. Your gender. It can be pretty \n', 'toxic stuff. But you know you are having success when people waste their time \n', 'trying to come at you online,” she says, with a laugh. “The internet allows for such \n', 'amazing community building, like the community we’ve built with FFFD. It can \n', 'be hard at times dealing with that darker side of digital engagement, but there’s \n', 'no point in listening to the negativity. We have to let the good shine through.”\n', 'In the future Iris wants to work on strengthening the communities that sup-\n', 'port the climate justice movement. “I’ve met some of my best friends building \n', 'communities that do good. And I hear from people all around the world every day \n', 'about how I’ve impacted them. It makes me want to create more communities, \n', 'and I want the people and the networks to become even stronger.” She believes \n', 'that they will be, when all people are given the tools and access to contribute \n', 'equally to the community and the movement. “Everybody can play a part,” she \n', 'says. “And it takes all kinds of people. For instance, I’m an introvert. I’m social-\n', 'ly awkward. And I’m not a great public speaker.

As \n', 'a child he would join his grandfather on his two-week fishing expeditions along \n', '49\n', 'the coast of Chile. One day, as the boat was pulling away from the wharf and \n', 'into the ocean, a dolphin swam by. It came so close to the boat that Joel could \n', 'practically reach out and touch it. “How wonderful!” he shouted. Now he’s 20 \n', 'years old; but still, every time he sees a dolphin, Joel says, “It reminds me of my \n', 'connection to nature.”\n', 'Joel grew up in the southeastern part of Chile, in two different regions that \n', 'experience climate extremes. Until he was eight years old, his family lived in \n', 'Chaiten, a small town of about 4,000 people. Then in 2008, the eruption of a \n', 'long-dormant volcano forced them to flee. They ended up on the island of Las \n', 'Islas Chiloe, on the edge of Patagonia, often called “the end of the earth.”\n', 'The big island of Chiloe is like something out of a dream: colorful houses \n', 'rise up on stilts in the water along the shore. Behind them are lush, green forests. \n', 'Here, about 40,000 people live in an area of just under 4,000 square miles.\n', 'As a curious child, Joel began exploring the incredible biodiversity of the \n', 'island. On Chiloe, the animals have to adapt to the extreme conditions, which \n', 'makes them remarkably diverse, and unique. There’s the pudu, the world’s smallest \n', 'deer; and the monito del monte, a marsupial the size of a mouse that exists only \n', 'in Chile and Argentina. In the summers, magnificent blue whales—the world’s \n', 'largest mammals—migrate through the coastal waters of southern Chile. “We \n', 'live in a place that’s so privileged with biodiversity,” Joel says. “There are tons of \n', 'beautiful species, and flowers too. You start to internalize that nature.”\n', 'Over the years, Joel has seen how human activity is causing harm to some \n', 'species, and throwing off the balance of the ecosystem. The Chilean dolphin, \n', 'which so inspired Joel when he was a kid, is listed as “near threatened” by the \n', 'International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Today, only about 5,000 \n', 'Chilean dolphins remain in the wild.\n', 'For years, the population of dolphins off the coast of Chile has been cut \n', 'down by overfishing, and pollution from ships carrying heavy containers filled \n', 'with industrial goods.\n', 'As is the case for the Chilean dolphin, for many of the marine and terrestrial \n', 'animals that live in Chile climate change is not even the greatest threat to their \n', 'livelihoods. Humans are. And for Joel, the only way to save the wide diversity of \n', 'animals that have made the extreme southern coasts of Chile their home—re-\n', 'gardless of whether they live on land or in the sea—is through education, on both \n', 'a local and a global scale.\n', 'That’s why Joel has made it his life’s mission to bring global awareness to \n', 'the environmental and human forces threatening biodiversity in Chiloe. He’s also \n', ' 50\n', 'committed to educating his local community. “People just aren’t aware about their \n', 'impact, or about how to take care of their environment,” he says. “We want peo-\n', 'ple to understand, and to really dig down to see the roots of the problems.”\n', 'Joel is the perfect emissary for his island community. Like much of the local \n', 'population of the Islas Chiloe, Joel comes from a Mapuche Indigenous back-\n', 'ground. He knew that in order to have the biggest impact, he would have to speak \n', 'with Indigenous leaders in each of the main cities and towns on the Big Island \n', '(Isla Grande). But he also knew he would have to bring his message to a global \n', 'audience.\n', 'That is why in 2019 Joel joined the Chilean branch of the global Fridays \n', 'for Future movement. In December he represented his people at the COP 25 \n', 'Conference in Madrid. There he joined with other youth leaders to call on world \n', 'leaders to do much more to protect marine ecosystems and respect human rights. \n', 'He was critical of his own country, where the economy has been prioritized over \n', 'the well-being of its people: where even basic goods like water aren’t free, but have \n', 'been privatized.\n', 'Returning from Madrid, Joel was inspired to found his own nongovernmen-\n', 'tal organization, along with 15 other young conservationists. They call it Chiloe \n', 'Protegido (Chiloe Protected), and they have developed creative ways of speaking \n', 'to the local populations about how they can work together to protect the island’s \n', 'biodiversity.\n', 'They’ve organized beach cleanups to remove plastic from the beaches. To \n', 'offset the loss of the island’s one animal rehabilitation center, which is no longer \n', 'active, they’re planning a training program to prepare aspiring conservationists \n', 'to treat wounded or sick animals. And they developed a phone app called Dón-\n', 'deLaViste?

Inspired \n', 'by Sylvia Earle’s Mission Blue, through which ocean “hope spots” are selected to \n', 'be protected, Joel wants to create a global youth movement aimed at protecting \n', 'the oceans.\n', 'For Joel, human activity is just one threat to marine ecosystems. Warmer \n', 'ocean temperatures, which lead to ocean acidification, have a devastating impact \n', 'on species like whales and dolphins. And the algae that blooms in warmer waters \n', 'leads to a phenomenon called marea roja, or red tide, which can be deadly for \n', 'marine animals.\n', 'There are other silent killers too, like radar waves from boats that disrupt \n', '51\n', 'the migratory and communication patterns of whales.

This movement \n', 'had three main demands for the Australian government: no new sources of fossil \n', 'fuels; transition to fully renewable energy by 2030; and the creation of a just \n', 'transition plan for workers currently employed in the fossil fuel industry.\n', '“At that point, few people knew about what Greta Thunberg was doing,” \n', 'Jean says. “But in Australia, the youth were inspired. In Castlemaine, a small \n', 'town near Melbourne, a few girls who read about Greta in The Guardian took up \n', 'the cause. They knew they had to bring this message to Australia somehow and \n', 'were in the process of organizing a strike in their capital city, Melbourne. I sent \n', 'them an email, saying I want to make this happen in in my capital city, Sydney. I \n', 'got their support, which was great, but it was also a lot of pressure. I’d never done \n', 'anything on this scale! We decided that we wanted to make a big impact, and in-\n', 'stead of having a series of small strikes, we decided to unify strikes across Australia. \n', 'And leading up to November 30, 2018, we started getting a little traction.”\n', 'Ultimately, what pushed the planned school strikes into the mainstream was \n', 'Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

She had learned that these redwood trees were being \n', 'cut down for timber by a company called the Pacific Lumber Company. “When \n', 'I found out that they were being destroyed, I knew that I had to do something to \n', 'try and protect them,” she said.\n', '“Luna” was a beautiful, majestic tree that had stood high atop a steep ridge \n', 'for 1,500 years and was 180 feet tall. The branches of this tree had grown in \n', 'curves and twists, which was probably what saved it from the chainsaws in the \n', 'first place: when the trees of the area were cut down for timber, the mills couldn’t \n', 'handle such an unevenly-grown tree.\n', '57\n', 'But now the famous tree was marked with blue paint, tagging it to be cut \n', 'down in December 1997. And people were protesting: activists were taking turns \n', 'staying in the trees, to keep the chainsaws from cutting them down. The organiz-\n', 'ers were looking for someone willing to spend more than just a couple of hours: \n', 'they wanted someone to stay a full week in one of the trees. “Nobody else would \n', 'volunteer,” says Julia. “So they had to pick me.”\n', 'Ever since she was a child, Julia has stood up for what she believes in. When \n', 'she was attacked by a group of teenage boys in the parking lot of a fast-food \n', 'restaurant, she knew she had to press charges, even though she also knew she \n', 'would have to face them again, in school. This experience taught her that there is \n', 'no backing down from what you believe to be right.\n', 'And Julia was convinced that cutting down these ancient trees was very \n', 'wrong. “How can we cut something like this down, and not think that we’re af-\n', 'fecting something much deeper than ourselves?” she says.\n', 'And so, on December 10, 1997, Julia began her attempt to save Luna. She \n', 'and a crew of eight fellow activists hoisted provisions to the top of the tree using \n', 'a pulley system. “After an hour and a half, we got the last of the provisions up. By \n', 'then it was midnight. Finally, I was able to put on the harness and ascend Luna. It \n', 'seemed an exhausting eternity before I reached the top,” she remembers. “When \n', 'I finally got to the top, I untangled myself from the harness and looked around for \n', 'a place to collapse.” Then she looked around at what would be her home for the \n', 'next week—the 6-by-6-foot platform where she was to live—and she prepared her \n', 'first meal on a little camping cooker.\n', 'But once she was in the tree, Julia realized that she was fighting for some-\n', 'thing much bigger than the survival of a single tree. “From up there, I was able to \n', 'see everything we stand for, and everything we struggle against every single day,” \n', 'she says. “I could see the beautiful forests stretching out; I could see snowcapped \n', 'mountains in the distance; I could even see the ocean.”\n', 'Whenever she would look out at the ocean, she would also see the Pacific \n', 'Lumber mill, the very factory that was planning on cutting down the tree that \n', 'she was living in. Looking out at all that natural beauty, Julia made a decision. “I \n', 'had to give my word to Luna, and to the forest; to myself, and to the world,” she \n', 'says. “I decided I wouldn’t come to the ground again until I had done everything \n', 'I possibly could to make the world aware, and to bring about some change.”\n', 'On her little platform 180 feet above ground, the days turned into weeks, \n', 'and the weeks turned into months.

Meanwhile, all around her, the logging continued.\n', '“There were miles upon miles of clear-cuts, as far as the eye can see,” she \n', 'says. “During the time I was up there more and more trees were destroyed, until \n', 'eventually I was surrounded by clear-cuts.” Sadly, today, only about 5 percent of \n', 'the historic redwood forests remain.\n', 'While living in the tree, Julia reflected on her traumatic childhood experi-\n', 'ences. She was used to overcoming obstacles, and she was willing to make sacrific-\n', 'es. Local people from environmental organizations jerry-rigged a pulley system to \n', 'deliver food and water to her. In winter, to keep warm she wore two pairs of socks, \n', 'two pairs of thermal pants, and wool pants, with ski pants over that. She also wore \n', 'two thermal T-shirts, a sweater, two windbreakers, and a raincoat. “I was getting \n', 'close to being as wide as I am tall, but it worked,” she says, laughing. To warm up \n', 'she would prepare hot tea on her little gas stove.\n', 'Besides the cold, Julia had to deal with harassment by Pacific Lumber. For \n', 'them, she was a serious problem, interfering with their ability to finish their job. \n', 'So they tried various methods of getting rid of her: they posted an eviction notice \n', 'at the bottom of the tree, and they even flew helicopters close to the platform \n', 'where she was living, hoping that the wind from the rotor blades would blow her \n', 'out of the tree. But Julia stayed put. She lived on the top of that tree for 738 days.\n', '“This old growth forest that is being cut down won’t come back,” Julia says. \n', '“If we hadn’t protected Luna, this world would never again have a Luna.”\n', 'The clear-cuts around Luna were causing other environmental problems \n', 'too. After cutting all of the trees in an area, the loggers would burn the soil using \n', 'chemicals. And without the trees to hold the topsoil, rain would wash the earth \n', 'downhill, causing chemical-infested mudslides. The chemicals then ended up in \n', 'the streams and rivers, causing irreversible damage to the environment.\n', 'In 1999, after two years of living in the tree, an agreement was finally \n', 'reached with Pacific Lumber. The lumber company agreed that Luna and all \n', 'trees within a 200-foot buffer zone around it would be preserved.

He \n', 'was about to speak in the UN General Assembly Hall, on the very podium that is \n', 'normally used by the presidents, prime ministers, and chancellors of the world. “I \n', 'was incredibly nervous,” Felix says. “Right before I went on stage, I just wished I \n', 'was in school.” That is quite an unusual wish for a 13-year-old.\n', 'In the audience was a woman who was very special to Felix. Her name was \n', 'Wangari Maathei. She was an environmental activist, and the first female profes-\n', 'sor in the East African nation of Kenya. For the past 30 years, she had worked \n', 'together with local communities to plant 30 million trees in African countries. \n', '“These trees had provided many women with their own income for the first time, \n', 'and protected the soil from erosion. But they also store carbon,” Felix says. “Every \n', 'tree extracts CO2 from the atmosphere.”\n', 'When Felix was five years old, he had gotten a present that he really loved. \n', 'It was a stuffed animal, a polar bear that was almost as big as he was at the time. \n', 'When, four years later, he had to give a presentation in elementary school about \n', 'the climate crisis, he immediately realized the gravity of the situation: because he \n', 'knew that polar bears were being threatened by rising temperatures and melting \n', 'snowcaps.\n', 'For his presentation, he tried to learn about possible solutions to the climate \n', 'crisis. That is when he first read about Wangari Maathei. Inspired by the work \n', 'she was doing planting trees in Kenya, at the end of his presentation Felix came \n', 'up with a proposition for his classmates: “Let’s plant one million trees in every \n', 'country on earth!” he said. That was in 2007, and it was the beginning of his \n', 'organization, Plant-for-the- Planet.\n', 'A couple of weeks after his presentation, Felix and his classmates planted \n', 'their first trees. Two local journalists reported on the event, and other schools \n', '61\n', 'heard about it and decided to join in. “Someone built a little website for us,” Felix \n', 'remembers. “It was basically a ranking of who had planted the most trees.”\n', 'Soon more schools joined the effort, and it became a competition: and one \n', 'year later the students had planted 50,000 trees. After three years they hit one \n', 'million! That is how Plant-for-the-Planet started to grow.\n', 'New studies show that planting trees is the most effective way to absorb the \n', 'harmful greenhouse gas CO2 from the atmosphere. “Trees are fantastic, because \n', 'they are the only machines we have that can absorb the CO2 we emit,” Felix says. \n', '“Every tree that we plant absorbs about 10 kilos of CO2 per year.”\n', 'With our current levels of emissions, that means that we have to plant a lot \n', 'of trees. And that is why Felix came up with a very ambitious goal: he and his \n', 'organization, Plant-for-the-Planet, are mobilizing the world to plant and restore \n', 'a trillion trees.\n', 'A trillion is a thousand billions—an almost unimaginable number.\n', 'But planting such a large number of trees is not only good for the climate: it \n', 'has other positive effects too. “When we plant trees, it helps to slow down deserti-\n', 'fication; it protects biodiversity; and it creates jobs,” Felix says.\n', 'Trees that are planted in tropical regions are particularly helpful. They grow \n', 'much faster than in other parts of the world, so they can absorb more CO2, and \n', 'they can do it sooner. The tropical regions of Latin America, Africa, and South-\n', 'east Asia also have the greatest amount of potential area for planting new trees.\n', 'And so, in March 2015, Plant-for-the-Planet started planting trees in the \n', 'Yucatan peninsula, in Mexico. Each tree they plant can absorb up to 200 kilos of \n', 'CO2 in only two decades—and they have already planted more than 6 million \n', 'trees. Their ambitious goal is to plant a million additional trees every year, and to \n', 'look after each plant, to make sure that it is thriving. Of course, they need a lot of \n', 'workers for this project. “In Yucatan we are already the biggest employer,” Felix \n', 'says, proudly.\n', 'According to a new study by scientists at ETH University in Zürich, Switzer-\n', 'land, there is plenty of available space on the earth for planting trees. In fact, they \n', 'have calculated that the amount of available space is equal to an area as big as the \n', 'United States of America.\n', '“All around the globe, there are large areas that can be reforested,” Felix \n', 'says. “Of course, global reforestation is not the only solution to the climate crisis.” \n', 'Another important factor, he says, is educating young people to stand up for them-\n', 'selves and argue for the importance of fighting the climate crisis. “So we began to \n', ' 62\n', 'offer academies,” Felix says. “The core idea is: we teach each other.”\n', 'In the academies, children learn how to give speeches and, of course, how \n', 'to plant trees. To date, Plant-for-the-Planet has organized more than 1,600 such \n', 'academies, and trained more than 91,000 children and youth in 75 countries. \n', '“Whoever dares to, later gives speeches to entrepreneurs, governments, and other \n', 'children, to get them on board,” Felix says.\n', 'Of course, planting a trillion trees is a very ambitious goal. That is why Fe-\n', 'lix, along with other Climate Justice Ambassadors from the Plant- for-the-Planet \n', 'academies, decided to work together to come up with innovative ways to do this. \n', '“What would Wangari Maathai do today, to connect people who want to plant \n', 'trees around the world?” they asked themselves. And the answer they came up \n', 'with was that probably she would develop an app.\n', 'Their idea was simple: just like when Plant-for-the-Planet first started, and \n', 'schools had competed with each other to see who could plant the most trees, they \n', 'decided that people worldwide should be able to share their tree-planting success-\n', 'es with each other.\n', '“So in 2019, we launched our Plant-for-the-Planet app,” Felix says. “It’s \n', 'amazing how much people like it, and how many people use it to plant trees! \n', 'Today there are more than a hundred tree planting projects on the app. But we \n', 'want to have hundreds.”\n', 'Of course, Felix and his fellow activists are fighting against time. Every year, \n', 'the world is losing around 10 billion trees per year. “Deforestation is the worst in \n', 'Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia,” Felix says. And while there are positive trends \n', 'in Malaysia and Indonesia, the current government of Brazil has actually weak-\n', 'ened many of the protections of the Amazon forest. “Still, in principle we’re \n', 'making progress when it comes to the protection of our forests,” Felix says.\n', '“There are many reasons to be disappointed when it comes to climate poli-\n', 'cies,” he says. “But slowly we are moving forward. It is a very important step that \n', 'with the Paris Climate Agreement we now have a common goal, and all of the \n', 'countries have made clear what their contribution will be.”\n', 'It is projects like Felix’s that have raised global awareness of the importance \n', 'of trees in the fight against climate change. To date about 14 billion trees have \n', 'been reported to the tree counter; and they now have 75,000 members. “Planting \n', 'trees is the easiest thing that we can do to alleviate the climate crisis, and everyone \n', 'can contribute,” Felix says.\n', 'Before she passed away in 2011, Wangari Maathai had started the One \n', '63\n', 'Billion Trees Campaign. Now it is up to the next generation to continue her legacy. \n', '“We took it to the next level,” says Felix. “It is now the One Trillion Trees Cam-\n', 'paign.

But there are also \n', ' 66\n', 'a lot of new and exciting ideas coming from the youth movements–and urgency is \n', 'the most visible. A lot of older people haven’t thought about the climate crisis the \n', 'way we have.

It really shows \n', 'how our climate emergency affects everyone; so we should come together across \n', 'groups to fight this battle.”\n', 'David also thinks it’s essential to educate the older community about the \n', 'connection between climate action and social justice, which is central to making \n', 'a positive change. “It’s up to us as youth, who are more versed in these things, to \n', 'clarify a major component of our activism: climate justice doesn’t mean anything \n', 'without social justice. If we don’t recognize that by now, then we have already \n', 'failed.” He pauses, then adds, “It’s not a fight between us and somebody else. It \n', 'should be an effort fought by all humanity together. For our own survival. Lifting \n', 'up one group, or race, or demographic, doesn’t mean we are making an enemy of \n', 'the others.

If there is more than one person, they must be approved \n', 'by the government.\n', 'So he stood for the climate alone because he had to.\n', 'Arshak hadn’t always been solo in his stand. In fact, his introduction to cli-\n', 'mate activism had been just a few days earlier, on March 15. Inspired by Greta \n', 'Thunberg’s global FridaysforFuture movement, a small group of activists had \n', 'gathered in “Hyde Park,” a small section of Sokolniki Park, far from the center of \n', 'Moscow. Since not very many people go there, that was the place the government \n', 'had assigned to them on their permit.\n', 'There, about 50-70 activists—mostly young people—gathered to send out a \n', 'call to Russia’s leaders, asking them to do more to protect the environment. After \n', 'all, Russia is the world’s fourth biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. And the activists \n', 'were painfully aware of the myriad ways climate change is affecting Russia. There \n', 'are forest fires in Siberia; there is flooding in the Irkutsk region that is melting the \n', 'Arctic permafrost. That in turn destabilizes biodiversity, and creates a feedback \n', 'loop that leads to further global warming.\n', ' 72\n', 'Standing in an out-of-the way park just wasn’t enough for Arshak. He knew \n', 'that protesting in a preapproved place, far away from those who most needed to \n', 'hear their message, wasn’t going to attract enough attention. So he decided to \n', 'venture out on his own and take the message to the public in a bold new way.\n', '“What can I do to support FridaysforFuture in Moscow?” he wondered. He \n', 'thought about it, and researched the laws about single-person strikes. “It seemed \n', 'like that was the only way,” he says. Then he chose to stage his solo protests in \n', 'Pushkin Square because it is one of the most frequented plazas not just in Russia, \n', 'but in the world.\n', '“After that, I started to strike by myself in Moscow’s city center, where lots of \n', 'people could see my protest,” he says. “I thought maybe they would be inspired if \n', 'they saw me there with my sign every week,” he explains. And he adds, “As fellow \n', 'Russians, they knew that I was risking a lot by striking openly, and talking about \n', 'it openly.”\n', 'Next, in solidarity with other global youth climate activists, and in order \n', 'to share his message with other Russian youth, Arshak started posting photos \n', 'on social media. He was fully aware of the risk he was taking; everything from \n', 'being arrested, to doing jail time or getting a heavy fine, or even being subjected \n', 'to physical violence.\n', 'Soon people around the world began to notice his protests. One of them was \n', 'Greta Thunberg, who began to follow him on Twitter and retweet his messages.\n', 'His solo protests began to morph into a shared experience, as the internet \n', 'and young activists across Russia and around the world took notice. Then other \n', 'young Russians began to mirror his actions, and the community of climate activ-\n', 'ists in Russia began to grow. “People started to think that maybe it’s okay to do it,” \n', 'he says. “And that it’s not so scary – they started thinking they can do something \n', 'too.”\n', 'In a way, Arshak’s story of solitary activism didn’t really start in Russia. It \n', 'started in the mid-1990s, in Yerevan, Armenia, where he was born. Arshak’s par-\n', 'ents had fled to Russia from their Armenian homeland when he was just a year \n', 'old. They were escaping a 10-year-long armed conflict that had devastated their \n', 'country, reduced neighborhoods to shambles, and destroyed the economy.\n', 'Growing up in Moscow, Arshak had felt a profound sense of isolation. \n', 'School was difficult for him, and other kids picked on him because he was a for-\n', 'eigner. “It’s quite complicated to tell what it is like to live in Moscow,” he says. \n', '“When I was a kid, I faced lots of challenges because I was Armenian.” But instead \n', 'of letting the bullying get him down, Arshak dove headlong into learning music. \n', '73\n', 'He picked up the violin at an early age and began to practice incessantly, learning \n', 'ballads and other tunes. He developed a special affinity for the music of Chopin. \n', 'At the age of nine, he was accepted to an academy for aspiring musicians, where \n', 'he began his classical training.\n', 'And so, throughout his life, Arshak had spent a lot of time alone. Perhaps \n', 'that’s what gave him the determination and the stamina to go through with his \n', 'solo strikes, despite the cold and wind of a Moscow winter, and his fears about \n', 'breaking the law.\n', 'Even when he was still in the Russian school system, Arshak had realized \n', 'the environment wasn’t being studied. In fact, environmental issues weren’t being \n', 'taken seriously at all. Yet Russians have good reason to be concerned about the \n', 'havoc climate change could wreak on their country and its economy. Scientists \n', 'have warned that Russia’s carbon dioxide emissions are warming at a rate twice \n', 'that of the global average. As a world leader in international organizations, and \n', 'with a seat on the United Nations Security Council, Russia has an important voice \n', 'in deciding what the climate’s future will look like.\n', '“Other countries can say, if Russia doesn’t act, then why should we?” Arshak \n', 'says. “So, it’s very important that every country should start acting as if this is a \n', 'crisis, and reduce their emissions dramatically. Now!”\n', 'Arshak began to gain international renown for his activism. He was invited \n', 'to join Greta Thunberg on stage at the 2019 COP 25 conference in Madrid. He \n', 'realized that he might have to spend time in jail when he returned to Russia. But \n', 'from the stage he told the people gathered, “I am not afraid to be arrested. I am \n', 'afraid not to do enough.”\n', 'Upon his return from the conference, Arshak returned to Pushkin Square \n', 'for his strike. This time, he was arrested by the Russian police for staging an \n', 'unlawful “mass protest”—of three people—and sent to prison for six days. As \n', 'everyone knows, Russian prisons are infamous for their treatment of dissidents. \n', 'People were worried about him and his future. Across the country and around the \n', 'world, a wave of support swelled up from his peers.\n', 'Though his prison sentence was intended to slow down the climate move-\n', 'ment in Russia, it had the opposite effect. During each day of his prison sentence, \n', 'crowds gathered outside of Russian embassies in cities around the world to protest. \n', 'Thousands more tweeted and posted messages of support. And after his release, \n', 'the movement came through even stronger than before.\n', 'Arshak was touched by everyone standing up for him. “It’s even helped our \n', 'movement a little bit,” he says. He pauses, then adds, “It’s not so scary to be in jail \n', ' 74\n', 'for six days. It’s more scary not to have a normal future, I think.”\n', 'The more involved he’s become with climate activism, the less lonely Arshak \n', 'feels. The sense of solidarity he feels with other climate activists has even had an \n', 'effect on his everyday life. “Before, I was playing violin, reading books, sitting at \n', 'home and studying, but I was really quite lonely,” he says of his life before joining \n', 'Fridays for Future. “After I became a climate activist, I found a lot of friends, other \n', 'activists who were supporting me, or striking with me. I was so much more lonely \n', 'when I was just a person studying, and living my life.”\n', 'Thanks to Arshak’s efforts the climate movement in Russia is slowly growing, \n', 'in spite of the restrictions on public protesting. They’ve found creative ways to \n', 'get around the limitations imposed by Russia’s authoritarian system. For example, \n', 'during the global climate march in September of 2019, Arshak was joined by \n', 'about 70 other “solo” protesters, who took turns staging their own personal pro-\n', 'tests one by one in Pushkin Square. They organized queues, and as each protestor \n', 'took his or her turn, they would exchange posters, while other protestors stood \n', 'nearby “so we didn’t feel alone.” About 700 people in more than 25 other Russian \n', 'cities joined the climate march.\n', 'Then Arshak organized an online “flash mob” with the hashtag #LetRus-\n', 'siaStrikeForClimate. People who are afraid to strike can share pictures calling for \n', 'climate action, and others from around the world can support them. Through his \n', 'activism, Arshak has expanded the FridaysforFuture movement beyond Moscow \n', 'to seven other cities across Russia. He attributes the success of the growing move-\n', 'ment to a constant process of education and advocacy.\n', '“We are not just striking,” he says. “We are organizing lectures; we are com-\n', 'municating with all the movements that are trying to build a new society, and to \n', 'find some ways to do it. So, I’m not alone anymore.”\n', 'But he also knows that for every step forward, there are many more to take. \n', '“People are suffering from the climate crisis now in a lot of places,” he says. “We \n', 'cannot prevent everything from happening; but we can try to do something beau-\n', 'tiful and good for our future.”\n', 'The future depends on what you do today.\n', 'Mahatma Gandhi\n', '75\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Support Arshak by using the hashtag #LetRussiaStrikeForClimate. \n', 'Join with Arshak and those organizing climate action strikes on the \n', 'Fridays for Future website: www.fridaysforfuture.org.\n'], 'tags': [[72, 'carbon/greenhouse gas emissions'], [74, 'carbon/greenhouse gas emissions'], [76, 'climate change other regions'], [72, 'climate strikes solo'], [72, 'fires forest fires'], [72, 'flooding Russia'], [72, 'Fridays for Future Russia'], [75, 'Gandhi, Mahatma'], [74, 'government responses to climate activism'], [72, 'greenhouse gas/carbon emissions'], [74, 'greenhouse gas/carbon emissions'], [72, 'Makichyan, Arshak'], [72, 'permafrost thaw'], [72, 'risks of activism in Russia'], [72, 'Russia'], [73, 'social media organizing climate strikes'], [75, 'social media organizing climate strikes'], [72, 'solo strikes'], [73, 'strikes organizing on social media'], [75, 'strikes organizing on social media'], [72, 'strikes solo'], [72, 'water flooding']]}, '11': {'person': 'Alejandro Martinez', 'title': 'The Art Of Saving The Planet', 'start_page_number': '76', 'end_page_number': '80', 'story': ['The Art Of Saving The Planet\n', 'Alejandro Martinez | Spain\n', 'Alejandro Martinez is fighting to preserve his country’s natural beauty. “It’s \n', 'really about having an appreciation for beauty,” he says.

He isn’t your ordinary Arctic \n', 'explorer. Of course, there aren’t really any ordinary Arctic explorers. But Parker \n', 'doesn’t cut a particularly imposing figure, nor does he fit the archetype one might \n', 'assume when trying to conjure up the image of a heroic figure standing at the \n', 'top of the world. On looks alone, Parker could even be considered unassuming. \n', 'He’s slight of build. Soft-spoken. He has said about himself that he’s “the least \n', 'athletically impressive person ever to visit the poles,” which gives you a glimpse \n', 'into his quirky, light-hearted nature. Parker is humorous, humble, and whenever \n', 'he addresses a crowd, which he often does, he’s always measured in his speech and \n', 'clear in his singular message: it’s his generation’s responsibility to take up the reins \n', 'in the fight against climate change.\n', 'By the age of 17, Parker had already made three separate expeditions to the \n', 'Arctic. His first visit was with the renowned Arctic explorer Robert Swan, who was \n', 'the first person to walk both the North and South Poles. On this expedition, they \n', 'stayed at a base ran entirely on renewable energy sources, which fascinated Parker. \n', 'His initial foray to the Arctic had been in a scientific capacity. Here, his interaction \n', 'with green technology, coupled with seeing the dire situation for himself firsthand, \n', 'lit a fire in Parker that compelled him to get involved in the fight against climate \n', 'change in a much more permanent and impactful way.\n', 'Climate change is affecting the entire planet, but it affects certain areas, like \n', 'the Arctic, disproportionately. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-\n', 'mate Change (IPCC), “Antarctica has experienced air temperature increases of \n', '3°C in the Antarctic Peninsula. Although that might not seem very much, it is 5 \n', 'times the mean rate of global warming.” Understanding the precariousness of the \n', 'situation at hand, the expedition Parker was on set various scientific goals for their \n', ' 84\n', 'visit. Parker himself was involved in gathering the rarest of rare commodities: \n', 'Arctic snow samples. These would ultimately act as a Rosetta Stone of sorts for sci-\n', 'entists the world over, when Parker successfully brought them back to the research \n', 'station. This is because the Tritium in the snow samples acts as a relatively reliable \n', 'oceanic tracer of sorts, and can reveal hidden–and changing—patterns of ocean \n', 'circulation and ventilation that can’t be observed with the naked eye.\n', 'These might seem like larger-than-life responsibilities for someone so young, \n', 'and in a way they are. But that doesn’t change the fact that in most every other \n', 'way, Parker was just the same as any other ordinary teenager.\n', 'As an American student at Eton, an illustrious British boarding school for \n', 'boys, Parker always “felt like an outsider,” which he credits as a driving, if not \n', 'painful force in his development as a socially and environmentally conscious cit-\n', 'izen. His inability to fit in was no secret at Eton. He stood out as an obvious \n', 'foreigner, a culture-shocked teenager trying to adjust to a very different way of life. \n', 'During this period, he laments his “bad social skills” as being the reason he made \n', 'no friends, and subsequently spent a lot of time with his nose to the grindstone, \n', 'intently focused on his studies.\n', 'When Parker returned to school in England, he committed himself to serv-\n', 'ing a greater purpose than his own. He spent his days spreading the word about \n', 'the desperate situation at the poles to anybody he could. It didn’t take long for \n', 'him to realize that not everybody shared his passion for protecting the earth. He \n', 'wrote article after article on global warming, climate change, and stewardship of \n', 'the polar regions, but got little reaction. No one seemed to care about a 15-year \n', 'old’s point of view on these harrowing topics, even with the factual evidence and \n', 'scientific data at hand, backing his stance. So, what was it that was causing his \n', 'message to fall on deaf ears? Did he lack credibility because of his youth? Was it \n', 'political? Perhaps he needed to find someone more dynamic to help him spread \n', 'the message?\n', 'It proved to be a very confusing and disheartening period for Parker, who \n', 'had a quick, curious mind, and rarely struggled to achieve what he wanted to in \n', 'an intellectual sense. He had a message, and it was an important message, but it \n', 'wasn’t getting through. Perhaps idealistically, he thought that the climate situation \n', 'at the poles was so urgent, and indisputable from an evidentiary standpoint, that \n', 'any rational person would share his passion equally. On a personal level, he was \n', 'also struggling to fit in at school during this time, and it seemed to make his efforts, \n', 'which weren’t being received with any enthusiasm, feel all the more isolating and \n', 'meaningless.\n', '85\n', 'Over a century earlier, at the age of 22, Sir Ernest Shackleton had his Eureka \n', 'moment, saying, “I had a dream that someday I would go to the region of ice and \n', 'snow, and go on and on until I came to one of the poles of the earth.” At the age \n', 'of 27 his dream had been realized, when he joined Captain Robert Falcon Scott \n', 'on the now renowned Discovery expedition to Antarctica.\n', 'Ernest Shackleton is noted to have famously said, in the most understated \n', 'fashion, “Difficulties are just things to overcome.” And it would take an individual \n', 'with the cunning and resolve of Parker Liautaud, to come up with a new plan in \n', 'the face of this adversity, to truly make an impact in the expansive world beyond \n', 'the walls of Eton.\n', 'Whether it was on the news or at school, Parker always heard people talking \n', 'about global warming, and how climate change will disproportionately affect the \n', 'next generation. That’s why something has to be done – and now. “We have to \n', 'think about the children,” he recalls hearing someone say, and when he did, his \n', 'natural curiosity took over. If it’s going to affect us, why are we waiting for someone else to \n', 'address the problem? he thought. And that’s when Parker Liautaud, like his forbearer \n', 'Sir Ernest Shackleton before him, had his Eureka moment. He knew that the \n', 'global situation was dire, and that time was running out. More importantly, he’d \n', 'knew that he needed to find a creative way to engage his peers, so as to involve his \n', 'generation in the fight and get them invested in the larger cause. Besides, he didn’t \n', 'see anyone else doing anything but talking about the problem at hand.\n', 'After all, he’d had a rare experience that even the brightest Etonians hadn’t–\n', 'he’d actually seen the perilous Arctic firsthand. He had braved hostile territory. \n', 'He had stayed at a base run on renewables, living in the spirit of the cause he was \n', 'trying to marshal. He had learned about the Arctic’s fragile ecosystem, and its \n', 'unique role in moderating global temperature. He personally had done research \n', 'in service of the region’s protection and felt a kinship to it, even an ownership of it, \n', 'in a sense. So why not take it a step further? If he intended to ask as much of his \n', 'peers, surely he should have the wherewithal to stand up and lead them. Calling \n', 'on his past experiences, and with some careful calculation, he felt it was his respon-\n', 'sibility to do something more daring to increase his reach, that at once would fulfill \n', 'his duty of spreading the message about fighting climate change, while getting the \n', 'attention of his peers. Desperate times call for desperate measures, they say.\n', 'So that very day, Parker Liautaud decided he’d become the youngest person \n', 'in the history of the world to set foot on the geographic North Pole.\n', 'To achieve this goal, Parker enlisted the partnership and guidance of en-\n', 'vironmental campaigner Doug Stoup, with whom he raised all the necessary \n', ' 86\n', 'funding for their trip. This independent fundraising was important to Parker, as \n', 'he didn’t want the tenor of his trip, which was to get a message out to the young \n', 'people of the world about climate change and global warming, to be confused \n', 'with some thrill-seeker’s PR stunt. It would surely be a thrilling expedition, but \n', 'as anyone who has been to polar regions knows, the reality of a trip to the Arctic \n', 'can’t be undertaken with anything but complete and utter reverence for the in-\n', 'numerable dangers that are sure to arise, even for the most seasoned adventurer.\n', 'This is the part of the story where Parker Liautaud found himself at odds \n', 'with his forbearer, Sir Ernest Shackleton, who said, “Superhuman effort isn’t \n', 'worth a damn, unless it achieves results.”\n', 'On Parker and Doug’s attempt to reach the North Pole, their journey was \n', 'cut short just 15 miles short of their destination. The geographic North Pole is \n', 'simply a GPS location in the Arctic Ocean, and in the window of time they ap-\n', 'proached it, shifting polar ice sheets didn’t allow them the opportunity to make \n', 'landfall. For 14 days they waited for a break, but it never came. At last, with \n', 'supplies dwindling, and being no closer to their destination, they decided with \n', 'heavy hearts to abort the mission.\n', 'It pained Parker immensely to fail this way, and to fail so publicly. What \n', 'wore on him the most was not fulfilling his promise to their sponsors, the scientific \n', 'community, and above all, his peers, who he was asking so much of. But ultimately, \n', 'the situation was what it was, and both men had to acknowledge that as far as their \n', 'journey went, the Arctic environment “held complete control over us... and we’d \n', 'have to respect that.” Their superhuman effort wouldn’t yield the desired result. \n', 'To consider, as Shackleton said, that such efforts, that their efforts weren’t worth a \n', 'damn. Or worse, if they were in vain...\n', 'In 2010, Parker Liautaud failed to be the youngest person in the history of \n', 'the world to reach the geographic North Pole. But it was in that moment of failure, \n', '1,000 miles from home and freezing in a torn-up tent in the Arctic, that Parker \n', 'remembered why he was out there – to serve a greater purpose than his own. \n', 'And in that sense, Parker succeeded. News of the 15-year-old explorer’s attempt \n', 'gained a bit of traction, and each time a new set of eyes were trained on his story, \n', 'there was a new opportunity to spread his message about fighting climate change.\n', 'It didn’t take long for Parker’s passion to grab hold of him again. A year \n', 'later, in 2011, Parker did in fact reach the geographic North Pole (though this time, \n', 'there was no record at stake, as he had been beaten by a younger adventurer). \n', 'Shortly thereafter, having conquered what they set out to, he and Doug Stoup \n', 'began to organize what would become The Willis Resilience Expedition, setting \n', '87\n', 'their sights on reaching the other pole. On this expedition, they set a record for \n', 'making the fastest human-powered trek from the coast of Antarctica to the South \n', 'Pole (a 397-mile journey in just 22 days, while trailing a 200-pound pulk). In the \n', 'process, Parker became the youngest man in history to complete the journey to \n', 'the South Pole.\n', 'If it weren’t for the endless stream of videos showcasing Parker addressing \n', 'enthralled audiences at the United Nations Foundation, TED talks, or the Clinton \n', 'Global Initiative, to name a few, it’d be difficult to imagine he’s a leading authority \n', 'on modern polar exploration. But as it turns out, Parker is unassuming in appear-\n', 'ance alone, and his credentials speak for themselves.\n', 'At the World Economic Forum in 2014, in Davos, he commanded a room \n', 'of influential global leaders with his tales from the ends of the earth. Wearing a \n', 'blue blazer and tie, and standing behind the heavy, wooden podium, he looked \n', 'no different from any of the businessmen and women in the audience who were \n', 'eagerly taking his story in—but anybody who knows Parker Liautaud will tell you \n', 'that what you see isn’t always what you get. Parker is extraordinary in many ways, \n', 'whether he looks the part or not.

Patel was sitting in class one day, listening to his teacher, when \n', 'suddenly he realized that something was wrong. At first his teacher didn’t believe \n', 'him—and he remembered that that morning he had drunk a lot of coffee, so \n', 'maybe that was why he felt so strange. But it felt more serious than that; his heart \n', 'was racing, and he could barely breathe. Finally, he went to see the school nurse, \n', 'who immediately called an ambulance, and Kevin’s parents. When he got to the \n', 'hospital, his heart was beating at 200-300 beats per minute.\n', '97\n', '“I will remember that day for the rest of my life,” Kevin says. “That one \n', 'moment changed my life forever.”\n', 'Kevin started researching. He was wondering why a healthy boy like himself, \n', 'who was physically active, had regular check-ups, and had never had any prior \n', 'health problems, would suddenly get such serious heart palpitations.\n', 'His health scare had serious consequences. For two years, he was in and out \n', 'of the hospital. When they saw him, his schoolmates would ask him in a surprised \n', 'tone if he had changed schools. “I knew that I was being affected by air pollution \n', 'and smog, because my neighborhood is so heavily polluted,” Kevin says. “What \n', 'else would cause a heart issue like this?” And he adds, “A lot of other members of \n', 'my community were getting heart issues as well.”\n', 'Kevin lives in South Los Angeles, a community that he himself describes as \n', 'marginalized. There are many issues in his neighborhood he says—homelessness, \n', 'no access to healthy foods, and of course, air pollution. Already in middle school \n', 'he had been advocating on the issue of food inequality. “Our community is essen-\n', 'tially a food prison,” he says. “We don’t have access to good food, organic foods, \n', 'like more affluent communities have.”\n', 'As an Indian-Asian-American in a mostly African-American and Latin-X \n', 'community, Kevin had always felt marginalized, within a marginalized popula-\n', 'tion. In school, there were clubs and resources for other members of his commu-\n', 'nity, but he was often the odd one out. So in ninth grade, when he returned to \n', 'school after the incident with his heart, Kevin decided to start his own club, to \n', 'deal with the issue that had affected him on such a personal level: he started an \n', 'Environmental Club.\n', 'To his surprise, and delight, the club was a huge success. For the first meeting, \n', 'more than 100 students showed up; they couldn’t all fit into one classroom. Over \n', 'the next four years, Kevin’s Environmental Club tackled issues like reducing food \n', 'waste, often combining their environmental work with other societal problems, to \n', 'create synergies. For example, they installed bins at the school to collect dry food \n', 'items from students who would have otherwise thrown them into the trash, and \n', 'donated the collected items to organizations working with the homeless.\n', 'They also got everyone to help with recycling: whenever someone on cam-\n', 'pus would find a bottle, they could throw them into the recycling bins put up by \n', 'the Environmental Club. The club then used the money generated from recycling \n', 'the bottles to donate to food banks.\n', '“It was astonishing to see how much of a success we were,” Kevin remembers. \n', '“It was a real change within our school. They’re still continuing this project today.”\n', ' 98\n', 'Both as a student who had been interested in food issues from an early age, \n', 'and then as an environmental justice activist after his heart problems began, Kev-\n', 'in feels he didn’t have much of a choice.\n', '“My activism is literally a survival tool,” he says. “It’s something I have to do, \n', 'in order to make sure that my community has a voice.”\n', 'Kevin had known about the facts of climate change for a long time: as a \n', 'child he wanted to become a botanist, so he knew about the effect of global warm-\n', 'ing on plants. But because he is from a low-income neighborhood, he argues that \n', 'his community is particularly affected by climate change.\n', '“We are given little to no resources to combat these issues,” he says. “We \n', 'also have deadly fossil fuel infrastructure in our communities. Many affluent \n', 'communities are not as affected by the climate crisis as much as marginalized \n', 'communities like mine are.”\n', 'Over the years, Kevin became a well-known activist. He has introduced mo-\n', 'tions in Los Angeles County, and for some time he also worked with a number of \n', 'nonprofit organizations, like Zero Hour, Ignition Green, and the Student Climate \n', 'Emergency Coalition. He has also given a lot of talks at protests and other climate \n', 'action events. For some time he joined the Fridays For Future movement, and was \n', 'trying to convince as many people as possible that it’s high time to act.\n', '“We really need to start taking action; this is not a time to wait around for \n', 'change to happen through our government officials,” he says. “It’s really up to us \n', 'to take up the mantle, and start taking action.”\n', 'Kevin is also one of the UN ambassadors for the Together Band Initiative, \n', 'which is fighting for implementation of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development \n', 'Goals. And it was right before the 2019 UN Climate Summit, during the world-\n', 'wide Strike for the Climate, that a vague idea that Kevin had had before began \n', 'to take concrete shape. He started One Up Action, an organization that provides \n', 'climate activists from marginalized communities with support and resources, to \n', 'help them uplift their ideas to address the climate crisis and make them a reality.\n', '“I started working on One Up Action because I saw that young changemak-\n', 'ers and activists don’t have the resources they need to make their ideas become a \n', 'reality,” Kevin explains. “I really wanted to create an organization that can give \n', 'funds to young changemakers, or help them by providing them with connections \n', 'and opportunities, or just help them with individual actions.”\n', 'His organization started working in four different areas: they successfully \n', 'set up a Youth Climate Commission in L.A. County; they started a Community \n', '99\n', 'Science Program, which supports local changemakers; they have started chapters \n', 'of their organization in 32 countries around the world; and they introduced their \n', 'action chapter program, to support activists on the ground in their initiatives.\n', '“Young people are very, very smart,” Kevin says. “We are not only the lead-\n', 'ers of tomorrow. We are the leaders of today.”\n', 'And, for him, that is what the first-ever Youth Climate Commission in the \n', 'world is all about. It will connect 25 young changemakers in Los Angeles who act \n', 'in the capacity of commissioners, and give their feedback and input on climate \n', 'initiatives to the L.A County administration.\n', '“Their feedback is key,” Kevin says. “Whatever feedback the local govern-\n', 'ment receives, they have to take it into account; they have to make the changes in \n', 'order for their communities to be impacted in the right way.”\n', 'For Kevin, this model is an efficient way for young people to have a voice \n', 'in climate governance. One Up Action wants to introduce even more such com-\n', 'missions in the United States, and in cities across the world. That’s why they are \n', 'working closely with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group—an association \n', 'of 97 cities around the world that are dedicated to taking decisive climate action.\n', 'In Los Angeles, One Up Action has already been successful with their model \n', 'of youth participation. “When it was time for all the supervisors to vote on this, \n', 'they all voted yes. No one voted no on it,” Kevin remembers. “Then they an-\n', 'nounced that the Youth Climate Commission had passed unanimously, and the \n', 'room just erupted. There was so much excitement!”\n', 'Kevin feels that his prior work as an activist was an important factor in his \n', 'efforts to get the Youth Climate Commission started in L.A. The connections he \n', 'had built, and having an already elevated status that gave his voice weight helped \n', 'him organize the community and exert pressure. But it was never easy—and one \n', 'of the most important lessons he learned, he says, is that you can never give up in \n', 'the face of an obstacle. “It’s an uphill battle,” he says. “But in the face of adversity, \n', 'people need to step up. You should never be deterred from doing the work you \n', 'love, or the work that you want to do.”\n', 'There’s never been a ticking time bomb hanging over our heads.

It all began \n', 'with a letter that arrived at his house one day: it wasn’t meant for him. It was \n', 'actually addressed to his mother, but Linus saw it first. This was before he knew \n', 'how to read, but his interest was piqued by the picture on the envelope: it was of \n', 'a dead turtle, tangled up in a fishnet.\n', 'Linus asked his big brother to open the letter and read it out loud to him. \n', 'What he heard shocked him: it was a report about how big industries were emit-\n', 'ting chemicals and toxic waste, and using the planet as a garbage dump. “I just \n', 'really wanted to do something about it,” Linus says. “I wanted to know why these \n', 'companies were doing something so destructive; something that would cause so \n', 'much damage.”\n', 'Now 17, that feeling of outrage, he says, has remained with him to this day.\n', 'Linus sprang into action. He got together with a couple of friends and start-\n', 'ed baking. Their idea was simple: they would bake delicious cookies, sell them, \n', 'and donate their earnings to environmental organizations, for projects that were \n', 'fighting against climate change. His parents supported him, not only by allowing \n', 'him to take over the kitchen for his baking projects, but also by challenging him \n', 'in his convictions.\n', '101\n', '“They’re supportive, they often say, it’s great what you’re doing,” he says. \n', '“But they also question me, and help me to reflect on what I’m doing.” The ani-\n', 'mated debates over many family meals helped Linus strengthen his ability to justi-\n', 'fy the positions he takes. They would talk about activism and civil disobedience, or \n', 'discuss the roots of the climate crisis in our economic system. Once, Linus wanted \n', 'to discuss Obama’s foreign policy at 7 a.m., before his mother had had her coffee. \n', '“She was a bit overwhelmed, although she is normally an early riser,” he says. “I \n', 'think these discussions were kind of a nice training for activism.”\n', 'One day Linus started to realize how the environment right in his own back \n', 'yard was rapidly changing. Since he was a small child, he’d loved looking out his \n', 'bedroom window at the snowy peaks of the Bernese mountains, rising majestical-\n', 'ly above the clear blue water of Lake Thun, a layer of snow and ice covering the \n', 'mountaintops. But he began to notice a change in the picturesque landscape. He \n', 'could see that the snow and ice, which had appeared so ageless and so immovable \n', 'to him all of his life, was slowly starting to disappear.\n', 'Linus knows these mountains well: he is a good skier, and he often hikes \n', 'in the mountains with his family. He cherishes a memory from one family trek \n', 'to the Aletsch glacier, the largest glacier in the Alps, near his home. His parents \n', 'had taken a picture of him and his brother there, with the mighty glacier in the \n', 'background, when they were young children. Ten years later, they took another \n', 'picture of them, standing in the same place. This photo would prove to Linus that \n', 'the climate crisis had arrived at his doorstep. Something had changed.\n', '“There was no glacier in the background anymore,” he says, sadly. “It was \n', 'just gone.”\n', 'Once he realized that the snowcaps on the summits of the Bernese moun-\n', 'tains really were slowly disappearing, baking alone no longer seemed a sufficient \n', 'response. So, in December 2018, right before the Christmas break, Linus once \n', 'more got together with a couple of his friends: and this time they decided they \n', 'would call for a climate strike in Thun.\n', 'It was a Wednesday night when Linus asked around in his school who would \n', 'join in a climate strike the next day. Sixty people said they would join. But that \n', 'wasn’t enough for Linus and his friends; they wanted to have an even bigger event. \n', 'So they printed flyers, sent a press release to the local newspaper, asked everyone \n', 'to tell their friends and family, and to help them spread the word in their sports \n', 'clubs and music groups.\n', 'For the next event, 800 people turned up.\n', '“We all felt so empowered, because we just put tons of effort in,” Linus says. \n', ' 102\n', '“We got young people to take to the streets all over Switzerland. We got them to \n', 'raise their voices. It felt so great!”\n', 'Although Linus got the climate strikes started in his hometown, he feels that \n', 'much more needs to be done. As a youth movement, he and others have man-\n', 'aged to spread the word and get their message out: Climate Action Now! “That \n', 'should have been the point where the government takes action,” he says. “But I \n', 'feel like we are the ones who have to do it, because we are the ones that will be left \n', 'with the pieces if nothing happens.”\n', 'With its 40,000 inhabitants, the small city of Thun isn’t exactly the most \n', 'likely epicenter of climate activism in the country. “Switzerland has the second \n', 'largest GDP per capita in the world,” Linus says. “To me, that means it has a \n', 'special responsibility in the fight against climate change. It’s just so frustrating that \n', 'they seem to not care.” He adds, “We now know that this can be different: the cli-\n', 'mate strikes have moved online because of COVID-19. This has led governments \n', 'around the world to take unprecedented action.”\n', 'For Linus, this goes to show that if governments want to act, they can. He \n', 'points out that industrialized countries, including Switzerland, have contributed \n', 'the most to the situation we’re in. So they are the ones who should be leading \n', 'the effort to fight climate change. But at the moment, they are failing to fulfill \n', 'even their meager commitments to help less developed countries with the loss \n', 'and damages caused by the climate crisis. In 2015, at COP 21 in Paris, a hundred \n', 'billion dollars were pledged to support the countries that are most vulnerable to \n', 'climate change. But the money has never arrived.\n', '“One hundred billion dollars is actually the budget that’s spent on nuclear \n', 'weapons every year,” said Linus. “That’s just kind of killing me, how they set \n', 'priorities.”\n', 'Luckily, Linus is not alone in his outrage. In an article for the German news-\n', 'paper taz, Linus described his experience participating in the events surround-\n', 'ing the COP 25 negotiations in Madrid in 2019. There, climate strikers from \n', 'all continents came together to share their experiences and perspectives on the \n', 'climate crisis. They got up at 7:00 in the morning for working sessions on strategy \n', 'and communications, and met with activists and politicians. They even met with \n', 'Svenja Schulze, the German Minister of the Environment, to plead their case and \n', 'demand urgent action.\n', '“Campaigning is interesting for me,” Linus says. “Thinking of which groups \n', 'of society you want to address, what the message is, what the key points are if we \n', 'want them to come to the strikes.”\n', '103\n', 'In March 2020 Linus went to Brussels with Fridays for Future representa-\n', 'tives from all across Europe, to demand urgent climate action from the European \n', 'Union. “It was amazing to see people out on the streets for climate justice; we \n', 'will fight until we win,” he says. Since many of the events had been cancelled be-\n', 'cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, members of the European parliament instead \n', 'came to meet with these youth, to discuss the European Green Deal. “The Green \n', 'Deal carbon emissions reduction targets are too low; 55 percent by 2050 is NOT \n', 'enough,” Linus says. “Governments must increase their ambition for 2030 targets \n', 'if we are to keep global temperatures under 1.5 degrees.”\n', 'Of course campaigning and activism take time. That is why Linus’s high \n', 'school agreed to give him academic leave for one semester. He is now a full-time \n', 'activist and plans to spend some of his time in France to work on his language \n', 'skills. He knows that this will be time well spent. “With good campaigning and \n', 'smart strategic moves, we’re actually able to change some things,” he says. And he \n', 'adds, “There is nothing, at the moment, that makes me happier.”\n', 'Linus’s dedication to activism means that he has less time for his hobbies, \n', 'like photography, basketball, and skiing. But he knows that it is a race against time \n', 'to save the snowy peaks he loves. He also knows that he is not alone in this fight. \n', '“To all the amazing activists and trailblazers out there: we will rock this,” he says. \n', '“We will keep fighting until we win!”\n', 'And to everyone else, he adds, “You do have a voice; and of course you want \n', 'a future.

The assignment was to write about someone who inspired her. \n', 'For Slater, the choice was clear. She had reached out to Jean-Michel Cousteau \n', 'because she admired his work as an environmentalist, and his friendly and open \n', 'way of talking to people.\n', 'Not only did the famous oceanographic explorer answer her questions: he \n', 'invited Slater to come visit the camp. “That was the first time I felt like someone \n', 'who was very important took me seriously, and wanted to listen to what I had to \n', 'say,” she says. “He was a big influence for me.”\n', 'When she met him in person, she recorded a video interview with him. At \n', 'the time she was working as a youth journalist with the My Hero project, a website \n', 'that shared inspiring stories on the internet. With a father who was a writer, and a \n', 'mother who was a film producer, Slater had always been in love with telling stories. \n', 'She made her first film when she was only six years old. “It was a musical, and I \n', 'wrote all the lyrics and the music. And I made my parents act and sing it,” she says. \n', 'The same week she also shot another film, which she starred in herself, along with \n', 'her dog. It was entitled The Girl and the Talking Dog.\n', 'Slater also loved watching movies. When she was 14 years old, she sat in her \n', 'parents’ living room and watched An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary made by \n', 'Davis Guggenheim, about global warming. It was eye-opening for her. “I remem-\n', 'ber about halfway into the film, I started crying and I didn’t really stop for about \n', '105\n', 'four or five hours,” she says. “It scared the hell out of me. It wasn’t something that \n', 'I understood or knew how to fix, and the people who could fix it were not doing \n', 'anything.”\n', 'Slater felt betrayed. All of her life she had been told that she had opportuni-\n', 'ties in her life, things that she could do and dreams she could realize if she wanted \n', 'to. Suddenly, she started to question this. “None of it felt like it was real anymore, \n', 'because there was this big thing called climate change rising up in the middle of \n', 'my life, that made everything uncertain and unstable,” she says. “And I wanted \n', 'to do something. I wanted to be the person who had tried to do everything they \n', 'could.”\n', 'Slater was born in Los Angeles. Her house had a tiny backyard and it wasn’t \n', 'really safe for her to walk around the neighborhood. She constantly heard the \n', 'blaring of sirens, and her school would have lockdowns semi-regularly, every time \n', 'someone tried to rob the bank down the street. But when she was nine, she and \n', 'her parents moved to a farm outside of Toronto.\n', '“I think it really shaped the kind of person that I am, being able to spend \n', 'days and days out in the woods, learning different bird calls,” she says. “And just \n', 'feeling like I was one small organism in this greater ecosystem.”\n', 'Spending so much of her life in nature taught Slater an appreciation and \n', 'awareness for the changing seasons, and the constant circle of life and death \n', 'all around her. She also learned more about climate change, and the more she \n', 'learned, the more she began to question political leaders and authority figures. \n', 'If the people who were in a position to do something about climate change had \n', 'decided not to do anything, then who would? If they aren’t willing to act, they should \n', 'step aside, she thought.\n', 'In May 2008, when she was 15, Slater went to the Youth Environmental G8 \n', 'Summit in Japan.

And they had all \n', 'had enough.\n', 'Slater brought her camera to the summit. There she made lifelong friends, \n', 'and it was also there that she started what would become a 12-year documentary \n', 'film project. She decided she would tell the story of the environmental youth \n', 'movement from within. The result was a documentary entitled Youth Unstoppable.\n', '“It was literally just me with a backpack and a camera, but I was lucky to \n', 'have the support of two producers, my mom and Daniel Bekerman, who trusted \n', 'me enough to let me follow my intuition. My mom went with me to most of the \n', 'countries, and organized on the ground to get the footage we needed.”\n', ' 106\n', 'After the summit in Japan, Slater went on to travel to a number of other \n', 'climate conferences, (COPs), in Copenhagen, Cancun, Paris, Poland, and Madrid, \n', 'and she always brought her camera.\n', 'In Mexico, she would get up at 6:00 in the morning, take a bus to the confer-\n', 'ence venue, and go through strict security controls. Then she would talk to young \n', 'environmentalists and try to find good people to interview.\n', '“You go in, and there are just hundreds and hundreds of people surrounding \n', 'you, everyone going seemingly in opposite directions,” she says. “I was by myself, \n', 'working 14 hours a day and then going back at the end of the day, downloading \n', 'all of the SD cards onto my hard drive.” Then she would sleep for five hours and \n', 'do the same thing again the next day.\n', 'At the conferences, she would simply walk up to people and ask them ques-\n', 'tions. “At the beginning, I would have to say that a lot of it was adrenaline fueled \n', 'by terror,” she says, laughing. But soon she realized that she was actually in a \n', 'position of power: she had the ability to share these people’s stories, and they \n', 'needed their stories to be heard.\n', 'But it was also exhausting. “It was too overwhelming,” she says. “Climate \n', 'activism forces you to deal with worst-case scenarios, to ask difficult questions. It \n', 'makes you question a lot of the things that make up your life.” She pauses, then \n', 'adds, “And you do that alongside the frustration of seeing that year after year \n', 'people are not taking it seriously, people are not doing what they need to do, \n', 'governments aren’t taking it seriously.”\n', 'One thing that kept Slater going is the friendships she made along the way \n', 'with other young climate activists. “It was a lot of fun,” she says. “You’re going up \n', 'against something, and you feel like what you’re doing is right.

The \n', 'Paris Agreement had passed! Emails and texts started coming in like mad; some \n', 'of her friends were celebrating the Accord; others were disappointed that the deal \n', 'wouldn’t be legally binding.\n', '“I was very confused about how to feel,” Slater says. “Because it felt like a \n', 'victory; at the same time, it felt like it wasn’t enough.”\n', 'But, overall, Slater decided to look on the bright side: the way she saw it, this \n', 'deal was an opportunity to finally stop bickering and get to work on the problem. \n', 'That’s why she thought she finally had the ending for her film.\n', 'But it still didn’t feel quite right, and she still had lingering doubts. “It was \n', 'like, oh, is that it?” Slater says. “Is this the end of the film? Did we really win?”\n', 'Then in 2016, when Donald Trump was elected President of the United \n', 'States, it felt like a backlash to the successful environmental movement that had \n', 'made the Paris Agreement possible. So Slater kept on filming: and within a cou-\n', 'ple of years, the environmental movement had come back in full force, led by a \n', 'young Swedish activist who caught the world’s imagination, and who helped bring \n', 'together the energy of other dynamic and devoted youth leaders from around the \n', 'world.\n', '“To see Greta, Luisa, Jamie, and Xiuhtezcatl, and all the climate strikes, it’s \n', 'incredibly beautiful and inspiring and exciting, after trying for so long to have \n', 'young people’s voices be heard,” she says. “The school strike movement has be-\n', 'come such a worldwide phenomenon!

Upon his return, \n', 'he was a changed man. To share the essence of this powerful experience with his \n', 'family, he bought a guitar and taught his children to sing “We Shall Overcome.” \n', 'And now, to honor Dr. King and his legacy, the Institute closes all of our events by \n', 'singing this same song.\n', 'A few years later, when Congressman Lewis and I met again at a book sign-\n', 'ing, I told him about this new book. I asked for his permission to feature his story \n', 'as a 25-year-old, when he marched with Dr. King in Selma, and founded SNCC \n', '(the Student Nonviolent Organizing Committee), which played a key role in the \n', 'Civil Rights movement.

Jerome was inspired to found OneMi-\n', 'llionofUS, a nonprofit voting advocacy organization that galvanizes resources to \n', 'facilitate active voter turnout among young people.

She was outraged \n', 'that her generation’s right to a healthy, sustainable future was being ruined by bad \n', 'decisions being made some of its leaders.

Dennis Banks, from the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, was \n', 'famously known for his use of hot sweats, which he believed strengthened one’s \n', 'prayers, for our ancestors and for the world. We were taught to ask permission \n', 'before entering the lodge, and to say Mitakuye Oyasin (“All My Relations”). It was \n', 'there that I met the Hopi elder, Thomas Banyacya, who had been chosen to reveal \n', 'the Hopi prophecies for the future. A few years later I was invited to the Indige-\n', 'nous Peoples Sunrise Ceremonies on Alcatraz Island, called the “Unthanksgiving.” \n', 'My Indigenous friends have been my greatest teachers. It has been an honor \n', 'to work alongside my lifelong friend Nane Alejandrez from Barrios Unidos, who \n', 'serves as the Institute’s board member and shares his Indigenous teachings with \n', 'our young people. On the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico Nane led a feather cer-\n', 'emony to initiate one of our youth leaders at El Hombre de Puerto Ferro, where \n', 'the skeleton of a 4,000-year-old medicine man was discovered. We then worked \n', 'together with an artisan -- the last of the Indigenous Taino blood line -- to show \n', 'our young people how to create beautiful designs and handicrafts using local seeds \n', 'and calabash.  \n', 'In Hawaii, Nane and I paid our respects to my Hawaiian kupuna, Keala \n', 'Ching, and my dear friend Kaiulani Pono and her students at the Kanu o ka \n', '’Aina Learning ’Ohana.

In this community of \n', 'around 100 people there was no electricity or running water, but you could walk \n', 'for nearly 100 miles in any direction and be surrounded by nature. The Gwich’in \n', 'nation villages, some located in Alaska, and some in Canada, are along the migra-\n', 'tory route of the porcupine caribou herd, a primary food source for the Gwich’in \n', 'people. Whitefish, grayling, pike, and salmon migrate through the river systems, \n', 'and ducks and geese migrate in the spring and fall. As a child, Evon’s job was to \n', 'haul water from the river, where they kept a hole in the ice throughout the winter. \n', 'He carried five-gallon buckets of water on a wooden yoke over his shoulders. His \n', 'family kept a fire going day and night.\n', 'Despite what seems like a storied childhood steeped in natural beauty, Evon \n', 'faced challenges early in his life. The public education offered in his village was \n', 'sub-par, with just one teacher for grades 6-12. Evon’s mother moved them to \n', 'Fairbanks for junior high school so he could receive a better education. It was \n', 'during this time that Evon remembers being brought into a room with 14 other \n', 'Alaska Native boys, where a counselor told them that they were more likely to end \n', 'up dead or in jail by the time they were 25 than they were to graduate high school. \n', 'Sadly, his words proved true. Of the 14 boys, one committed suicide and only one \n', 'or two finished high school.\n', 'When he was 16 years old, Evon had an epiphany about the profound ineq-\n', 'uities between the Native and non-Native peoples in Alaska. “We are not taught in \n', 'our schools about the history of colonization and the assimilation of Indigenous \n', 'peoples; and the trauma and social challenges that persist in many Indigenous \n', 'communities as a reflection of those experiences,” he says. “And there is a contin-\n', ' 120\n', 'ued colonization of Indigenous peoples that persists to this day as well.”\n', 'He had learned about the boarding schools his mother had been sent to, \n', 'where they were not allowed to speak their language, and told that their spiritual \n', 'practices and traditions were wrong, and that they must be forgotten if they want-\n', 'ed to fit into society. This deeply affected his mother, who demonstrated symptoms \n', 'of a “heart wound,” Evon says. When Evon was growing up, his mother would \n', 'sometimes lock herself in her room and cry.\n', 'Evon had dropped out of high school, but later he argued for admission into \n', 'the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), where he received his BA in Alaska \n', 'Native Studies, with a minor in Political Science. As a college student, he became \n', 'active in student government, where he organized and co-led a Native student \n', 'organization. These experiences launched him on his lifelong quest to learn about \n', 'the history and laws that have contributed to the suffering of Alaskan Indigenous \n', 'communities. “I learned that my grandparents weren’t citizens of the United \n', 'States when they were young,” says Evon. “They didn’t have the right to own \n', 'land or own a business. They were explicitly discriminated against in our own \n', 'homelands.” So it was with great pride, and deeply personal, that Evon testified in \n', 'February 2020 in a state legislative hearing on behalf of his people, for the passing \n', 'of HB 221, a bill which formally recognizes the tribal sovereignty of 229 Alaska \n', 'Native tribes.\n', 'In his early 20’s Evon became the youngest chief in the Alaskan interior. He \n', 'attributes this honor to being raised with strong roots in his Gwich’in identity, and \n', 'a drive to acquire Western education as well. “I spent the next three years strug-\n', 'gling to lead my people and learning the realities of being an Indigenous leader, \n', 'subject to the powers of the state and federal governments,” he says.\n', 'Because to a great extent Alaskan people live off the land, Evon is greatly \n', 'concerned about how his people will survive. “When I was younger, it was not un-\n', 'common to face 65 degree below zero weather for a week at a time,” he says. Over \n', 'the years, there has been a shift upward of approximately 13 degrees in winter, \n', 'and the change has had an undeniable impact on the people living in the Arctic. \n', 'Lakes are either drying up or are flooded, depending upon where they are, and on \n', 'how the thawing permafrost is affecting local geography. This leads to increased \n', 'erosion, especially in coastal areas, and also in the river systems.\n', '“We’re seeing a shift in the types of animals and species that are showing up, \n', 'or no longer showing up, in our lands,” Evon says. “We had a major die-off in the \n', 'Koyukuk River just this last summer. They’re speculating that the thousands of \n', 'salmon that died in that river died because the water was too warm. They over-\n', '121\n', 'heated and couldn’t make it up to their spawning grounds.” Evon also believes \n', 'that agricultural pollutants used in other parts of the world are migrating into the \n', 'Arctic. “It’s impacting the health and well-being of our people,” he says.\n', 'In 2014 Evon was appointed Vice Chancellor for Rural, Community, and \n', 'Native Education at UAF, which is the largest producer of Arctic research world-\n', 'wide. The chancellor of UAF is committed to strengthening global leadership \n', 'in Indigenous programs, including the preservation and documenting of Native \n', 'languages that are at risk of disappearing. “I never in my wildest dreams imag-\n', 'ined I would ever be a vice chancellor at a university,” says Evon, who quickly \n', 'realized the position gave him the opportunity to reshape education in Alaska, by \n', 'modifying both the curriculum and the teaching methods. He was responsible \n', 'for managing six community campuses across the state, serving students with 14 \n', 'different Indigenous languages, coming from 140 tribal governments, and 160 \n', 'communities. “I’ve been able to engage with so many young people,” he says, a \n', 'note of gratitude in his voice.\n', 'Central to the career path that led him to his role as vice chancellor was \n', 'Evon’s work as executive director of Native Movement, a nonprofit organization \n', 'he and his wife, Enei Begaye, cofounded in 2004. “Native Movement is a collec-\n', 'tive of around 15 organizers. We work on a range of projects that focus on youth \n', 'leadership development, sustainability, protection of sacred sites, and social, po-\n', 'litical, economic, and environmental justice,” he says. They have hosted a variety \n', 'of events, including vigils, marches, youth summits, concerts, and workshops.

Today they have \n', 'offices in Fairbanks and Anchorage; and they have expanded into the area of \n', 'missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n', 'Evon focuses on issues related to healing and trauma, and the integration \n', 'of Indigenous cultural practices with behavioral health interventions. “Our major \n', 'goal is to prevent suicide, which is at epidemic levels in some of our communities,” \n', 'he says. (It is a leading cause of death for Alaska Natives between the ages of 15 \n', 'and 24.) We Breathe Again, a documentary film that explores the impact of suicide \n', 'on the lives of four Alaskans, premiered in 2017 on the PBS World Channel’s \n', 'America ReFramed; and being one of the film’s producers offered Evon the op-\n', 'portunity to cast a wider net.\n', 'Native comedian and traditional Yup’ik teacher Keggulluk Earl Polk is fea-\n', 'tured in the film. “Sing. Go back to your roots. Dig deep,” he urges. “Hit your \n', 'knees, become humble. Realize that you’re stronger than what is trying to take \n', ' 122\n', 'you away. And the only reason you’re strong is because you’re humble enough \n', 'to ask for help.” Evon hopes that the film will continue to be a useful tool to help \n', 'build bridges of communication and healing for healthcare workers and patients \n', 'alike.\n', 'Evon will be stepping down from his role as vice chancellor in June 2021 to \n', 'deepen his work at the community level, as well as in international global advocacy. \n', 'He plans to continue his work with suicide prevention and immerse himself in his \n', 'passion for the preservation of Indigenous languages. “We have 20 Alaska Native \n', 'languages, and one of them has already lost its last speaker,” he says. “I want to \n', 'be part of helping to revitalize my language, the Gwich’in language. We’re down \n', 'to less than 800 speakers worldwide. Now is the moment for us to work with our \n', 'elders to document the language as best we can, and create a curriculum, and \n', 'lesson plans.” His dream is to create a Gwich’in language immersion school, or \n', '“nest,” where, starting at three years old, children would speak only in Gwich’in.\n', '“I know some people in higher education expect me to go on to be a chan-\n', 'cellor, or president of a university.

But she didn’t \n', 'always feel like she fit into the common stereotypes about Indigenous people, es-\n', 'pecially Indigenous women. In fact, growing up Lucia was a bit of a rebel.\n', 'Her first act of rebellion came when she was just four years old. When it \n', 'came to after-school activities, the gender roles in her small community school \n', 'were quite strict. Boys took karate classes, while the girls would learn to play in-\n', 'struments, dance, and cook. No one questioned this until Lucia came along and \n', 'decided to flip the gender roles upside down. When she was told that she couldn’t \n', 'attend karate lessons, she went up to her music teacher after class and told him, \n', 'simply and directly, that she wanted to do karate as well.

They supported her \n', 'creativity, gave her an education, and instilled in her a lifelong passion for art and \n', 'sports. But she also thanks something else for her political awakening—rock music.\n', 'Rock came into her life when she was 11. She liked the traditional music of \n', 'her Indigenous community, but she loved rock ‘n roll even more. She could hear \n', 'it on the radio from time to time when the signal from larger cities flitted onto \n', 'her radio at home. She listened to the Beatles, Rage Against the Machine, and \n', 'the Spanish folk metal group Mägo de Oz. She was especially inspired by Mägo \n', 'de Oz. In 2003, these Madrid rockers released the first album of a trilogy, “Gaïa.” \n', 'The album, which is named after the Latin name for planet earth, became like a \n', 'handbook for Lucia.\n', '“In my own personal development, I always talk about music, and especially \n', 'rock music, because that was the first thing in my life that politicized me,” she \n', 'says. “These groups spoke to me about the importance of protecting mother \n', 'earth; about sexual diversity, about the importance of loving everyone equally; \n', 'and about a whole heap of things that impacted me at that age.”\n', 'For Lucia, music provided a way to break down the stereotypes about In-\n', 'digenous Mayan women. She says it helped her to “decolonize” her mind from \n', 'Western thinking and begin to understand that being an Indigenous woman itself \n', 'required an act of rebellion against a system inherently structured against her. She \n', 'gained a newfound appreciation for the land, as well—a land that her community \n', 'had owned and protected against invasion from other countries for centuries.\n', 'Music would continue to be important to Lucia as she grew older, but now it \n', 'took on political importance. She finished high school and went to college to study \n', 'architecture. During her studies she became involved with student activist groups \n', 'and Indigenous land protectors. And on October 4, 2012, she and a number of \n', 'other students joined a national protest against a rise in electricity prices, which \n', 'was adversely affecting poor, Indigenous Mayans, like the ones in her community. \n', 'They took to the streets peacefully and called on the private energy monopoly to \n', 'lower the prices, but the movement was broken up by armed police. Six people \n', 'were killed, and many others arrested.\n', 'Less than three weeks later, the people protested the violent repression they \n', 'had suffered, by spraying the presidential palace in Guatemala City with red paint. \n', 'The government cracked down again and this time five more student activists \n', 'were arrested.\n', 'Among the students arrested were friends of Lucia’s, fellow activists like \n', 'herself. It was another moment that marked her young life and inspired her to \n', '125\n', 'take action.

And \n', 'what better way than music?\n', 'She’d already organized a number of cultural events in her community, \n', 'around issues involving the marginalization and criminalization of Indigenous \n', 'communities, and she knew a number of musicians from her time at school. After \n', 'the October 4 massacre, she began to make her cultural activities more politically \n', 'focused, and to tell both her story and the stories of others through art and music. \n', 'She reached out to her musician friends, and one by one, they began to volunteer \n', 'their voices, and their instruments, to the campaign to free the student activists.\n', 'Along with two friends, Lucia started Festivales Solidarios (Solidarity Festi-\n', 'vals) as a way to counteract the repression they felt, as well as some of the broader \n', 'challenges facing Guatemala’s Indigenous communities. Through music, spoken \n', 'word, poetry, and art they managed to build up the momentum to free their friends.\n', 'But Festivales Solidarios wasn’t just a one-time event. Every time an activist \n', 'or a student or a journalist faces prison simply for speaking out, Lucia, her sister \n', 'Andrea, and the rest of the team at Festivales Solidarios bring together artists and \n', 'musicians to amplify everyone’s voices together.\n', 'And their action soon morphed into something even bigger—a movement \n', 'that uses art and music to create change and is bringing awareness to a variety \n', 'of forms of repression and inequality that persist across the country. In 2019, \n', 'the group created The Panal Project, which focuses on finding new ways to tell \n', 'human rights stories, and strategic use of various media and digital platforms \n', 'to address issues of territory, historical memory, and political imprisonment.

But he wants to write a new \n', 'blueprint to help tackle it. In fact, his many years of practice have given him a \n', 'pretty good idea of what that blueprint will look like. It starts with four steps:\n', '1.  Vision. “You can never win by being against something,” he says. In-\n', 'stead, climate activists around the world need to present a new way \n', 'forward. A Green New Deal? Maybe. “You need to find the visionary \n', 'document, or idea, and explain how the world will be different if you \n', 'win.”\n', '2.  Unity. In order for the movement to succeed, it has to stay together. \n', '“How do you unite different players?” Srdja asks. The ideologies behind \n', 'climate change action can differ, but if nobody is on the same page \n', 'about what steps to take, the fight will quickly unravel.\n', '3.  Strategy. What’s the three-year plan, the five-year plan, for the cli-\n', 'mate revolution? “I think young people have always wished to change \n', 'the world, but they very often lack the tools and skills to exercise their \n', 'passion,” he says. It’s important to take the time to develop a plan that \n', 'can succeed.\n', '4.  Numbers. There’s one thing that’s more important than anything else, \n', 'and we’re seeing it displayed in cities and countries around the world—\n', 'as young people take to the streets en masse. “The most important thing \n', 'to know is the importance of having big numbers,” Srdja says.\n', ' 130\n', 'Becoming an activist—whether for climate action or other issues—is a life-\n', 'long job, Srdja emphasizes. And it can be difficult; but he assures youth that it’s \n', 'worth it. “It comes with a promise that you will never be bored; that you will be \n', 'surrounded by very interesting people; that you may be misunderstood by your \n', 'parents, who want you to work in a bank or have a law degree.

I loved it,” he says. “I couldn’t wait \n', 'to finish my schoolwork and chores so I could go out into the forest and explore \n', 'the creeks and plains; and watch the animals with my parents and grandfather.” \n', 'Little did he know that one day he would become one of the youth leaders pas-\n', 'sionately helping to bridge the gaps between environmentalism and social issues \n', 'in the national political landscape.\n', 'When Jerome first heard about climate change and global warming, he did \n', 'what he did with any academic subject – he read everything he could. Once he \n', 'had a strong base in the science, he dug deep into how these issues were impacting \n', 'the cultural conversation. “Watching An Inconvenient Truth, I was blown away by the \n', 'scale of the crisis,” he says. “Then when I saw how many people Avatar drew to \n', 'the theatres, I realized how people really cared about social justice. It was a huge \n', 'number! However, they weren’t being spoken up for in my circles.”\n', 'So when he was in middle school, Jerome started his first Facebook page: \n', 'he wanted his peers to understand what climate change, global warming, and \n', 'sustainability is all about. His habit of posting 4-5 times a day gained him a lot \n', 'of followers. Seeing that he could raise such awareness by himself, he decided it \n', 'was time he joined with others. “When I was in 8th grade, I jumped right in with \n', 'The People’s Climate March in D.C., as an intern,” he says. “I helped organize \n', 'climate marches, and made an immediate impact. It was so exciting; I even gave \n', 'presentations at my school.”\n', 'By the time Jerome was in high school, his bright, technical mind was fully \n', 'engaged. He was fascinated to learn about how tech could be used to revolution-\n', 'ize education and get young people more involved in social justice movements. “I \n', ' 132\n', 'always understood what BLM (Black Lives Matter), women’s rights, and other \n', 'mainstream social justice movements were about,” he says. “But I never realized \n', 'that these had anything to do with climate change. And when I did, I decided to \n', 'do something about it.”\n', 'Climate change and global warming impact women, minorities, marginal-\n', 'ized peoples, and Indigenous communities disproportionately compared to the \n', 'rest of the population. In the African American community alone, 71 percent of \n', 'the people live in areas where the air quality is unsafe, because of their proximity \n', 'to industrial manufacturing, and other factors. One day, Jerome’s teachers chal-\n', 'lenged him to use his technical abilities to highlight these issues by creating his \n', 'own little business. And they told him that the World Series of Entrepreneurship \n', '(TWSOE) was only five days away.\n', 'And so, at 14, Jerome founded TAU VR, a civics-based virtual reality com-\n', 'pany that promotes empathy and compassion. In TAU VR’s 3D virtual space, \n', 'people have a simulated experience of another person’s experience. Jerome’s \n', 'model simulated the experience of a 5-year- old migrant child from Guatemala \n', 'making the dramatic and difficult journey to Texas. “Parts of Central and South \n', 'America are becoming uninhabitable due to climate change,” Jerome says. “By \n', 'vicariously experiencing a journey like this, it can give people a more sympathetic \n', 'view of those who are suffering from our global environmental crisis. It can help \n', 'the average person understand the many obstacles that my character is dealing \n', 'with.”\n', 'While TAU VR was a success, Jerome felt that he had much, much more \n', 'to offer. Shortly thereafter, he had another jolt of inspiration. “I saw Leonardo \n', 'DiCaprio’s documentary Before the Flood. The whole film was amazing,” he says. \n', '“At the end, he had a message that there aren’t enough people covering climate \n', 'change in a way that it should be covered—especially young people. I realized \n', 'that not only was he right, but I could actually be the one to try to remedy this \n', 'problem.” And so, in 2017 he created his next entrepreneurial venture in digital \n', 'media: The Climate Reporter.\n', 'The Climate Reporter is a collection of international youth writing about climate \n', 'change, global warming, environmental justice, and other sustainability issues \n', 'around the world. The site has a wide range of journalistic products, including \n', 'op-eds, films, videos, podcasts, interviews, breaking news, stories from frontline \n', 'communities, and an impressive range of cutting-edge digital content. The envi-\n', 'ronmental news site receives roughly 600,000 views a month, and is among the \n', 'top up and coming publications in the youth sustainability space.\n', '133\n', 'The Climate Reporter’s excellent reporting got the attention of notable climate \n', 'change youth leaders, like Greta Thunberg and her team. Then in 2019, Jerome \n', 'organized the D.C. chapter of the worldwide youth School Strikes for Climate. To \n', 'lend her star power and show her support for the Global Climate Strikes, Greta \n', 'traveled for the very first time by sailboat from Europe to New York, and then \n', 'went on to Washington, DC Her presence at these strikes raised an enormous \n', 'amount of awareness, and garnered overwhelming support for the movement. \n', 'Other notable activists, celebrities, and entrepreneurs began joining in, inspired \n', 'by Jerome’s infectious spirit, among them lifelong activist Jane Fonda, who stood \n', 'beside him.\n', 'Inspired by these courageous young leaders, Ms. Fonda launched her Fire \n', 'Drill Fridays. Every Friday, from November through February, hundreds of peo-\n', 'ple, including Jerome, have joined with this famous actress and lifelong activist to \n', 'raise awareness about the climate emergency by protesting at the nation’s capital. \n', 'Other celebrities have joined her too, using their star power to get media attention \n', 'for the cause. As they increasingly engaged in very visible and strategic acts of civil \n', 'disobedience, some of them, including Ms. Fonda, were arrested.\n', 'After each climate strike, Jerome met with congressional staff at the U.S. \n', 'Capital to talk about what they could be doing for climate justice. His diligence \n', 'led to a life-changing opportunity for Jerome when he was invited to serve as an \n', 'intern and be mentored by U.S. Representative John Lewis. Jerome was aware of \n', 'how this legendary congressman had, as a 25-year-old, marched with Dr. Martin \n', 'Luther King Jr. in Selma, Alabama, and had helped to create SNCC (the Student \n', 'Nonviolent Organizing Committee), which played a key role in the Civil Rights \n', 'movement. “To be able to learn from this true civil rights icon was amazing,” \n', 'Jerome says. “It really made me rethink a lot of my prior assumptions about what \n', 'is important—especially about giving back.”\n', 'With service and social responsibility in mind, Jerome founded OneMil-\n', 'lionOfUS, a nonprofit voting advocacy organization that galvanizes the resources \n', 'needed to facilitate an active voter turnout among youth. To help make the voting \n', 'process easier and more affordable for youth, Jerome created partnerships with \n', 'companies like Lyft, which provides discounted rides for youth to help them get \n', 'to voting stations. Then, before the 2020 elections, Jerome had a lofty goal–to get \n', '1,000,000 youth voters registered in time to vote. It was an intense, exciting, and \n', 'ultimately successful endeavor. It is estimated that 52-55 percent of the country’s \n', 'youth voted in that election, and their impact was huge—especially among young \n', 'people of color, who overwhelming supported President Joe Biden. It was an \n', ' 134\n', 'especially powerful time for Jerome, who joined forces with other organizations \n', 'to successfully fight for U.S. Congressman Lewis’s former Congressional seat in \n', 'Clayton County, Georgia. And in the spring of 2021, Jerome was honored to be \n', 'invited to join President Biden’s Inaugural Environmental Justice Advisory Coun-\n', 'cil at the White House to help plan a strategy to combat the global climate crisis.\n', 'For youth who want to be involved in social justice, advocacy, and other \n', 'cause-related work, Jerome’s message is simple: “Start with empathy and under-\n', 'standing,” he says, advice that applies to many diverse pathways. He believes that \n', 'starting by educating oneself on the issues you are passionate about is the key. \n', '“Read an article about it. Then read five more. Watch documentaries.

With such victories, local jurisdictions would be forced to consider ways \n', 'to implement green energy sources and to address habitat destruction, both of \n', 'which would benefit the environmental defenders who are most affected by these \n', 'policies.\n', 'On September 25, 2020, YACAP made headlines when they held a Global \n', 'Day of Climate Action. This campaign aimed to amplify the voices of MAPA, \n', 'who are often thought of as voiceless.“MAPA are often unheard – but we are \n', 'not voiceless,” Mitzi says. “We are battling the climate crisis today, and so we \n', 'are fighting, not just for our future, but also our present. We will not let the most \n', '141\n', 'impacted among us be prisoners of injustice.”\n', 'Their  digital  campaign  (#FightClimateInjustice)  consisted  of  “Twitter \n', 'storms” during which youth activists posted pictures of themselves making the \n', 'MAPA symbol of solidarity, with their hands chained. Forming fists with both \n', 'hands, and holding them together, with thumbs up, is the sign for “solidarity” in \n', 'sign language. It also has a dual symbolic importance, since this is the gesture one \n', 'makes when being handcuffed. This symbol is meant to show that the environ-\n', 'mental community will not be taken prisoner by the world at large.\n', 'This Global Day of Climate Action garnered so much support that it con-\n', 'tinued on in digital form for many days after the event took place in order to \n', 'accommodate youth around the world who wanted to continue to show support \n', 'and solidarity for MAPA.\n', 'On September 20, 2019, during YACAP’s Global Climate Strike with \n', 'Fridays For Future, Mitzi and YACAP met with Secretary Emmanuel M. De \n', 'Guzman of the Climate Change Commission, who led the Philippines’ climate \n', 'diplomacy on the Paris Agreement at COP21. Recognized as a global leader, he \n', 'hosted the first Climate Reality Leadership Corps Training Program in 2016. He \n', 'was pleased to receive Mitzi and YACAP’s Five Points of Unity and encouraged \n', 'them to stay strong and keep fighting for the people.\n', 'Since she began her work with YACAP, aspiring youth leaders from around \n', 'the world frequently contact Mitzi, and ask her for advice – and she’s glad they \n', 'do. “Getting involved can be intimidating, so don’t be afraid to ask questions,” she \n', 'says. “Sometimes, it feels like we are expected to know the ins and outs of every \n', 'issue. But no one person knows everything. My best advice is to find a mentor, \n', 'ask questions, read everything you can, and be willing to learn.” Mitzi is inspired \n', 'by trailblazing youth leaders across the world like Greta Thunberg from Sweden, \n', 'Disha Ravi from India, Nicki Becker from Argentina, and Laura Muñoz from \n', 'Colombia, with whom she fights side by side as a youth climate activist. But she \n', 'wants the spotlight to be on environmental defenders first and foremost. “It’s the \n', 'Indigenous forest defenders, the farmers and land defenders, the fisherfolk and sea \n', 'defenders who really keep me going on this journey. What I do is easy.”\n', 'Going forward, Mitzi plans to keep talking about the climate. “In the near \n', 'term, there is still so much we have to do in order to avoid the irreversible effects \n', 'of climate change. Which is why I plan to be vocal. But don’t forget - the goal of \n', 'climate activists should be to not be climate activists anymore.” While she knows \n', 'that’s the eventual goal, she believes she has her work cut out for the next decade \n', 'or so. Looking ahead, Mitzi plans to transition to working with a grassroots non-\n', ' 142\n', 'governmental organization (an NGO), both to amplify her reach, and to find a \n', 'network that will support her dream of mentoring youth environmental leaders. \n', '“I feel the need to fulfill my purpose of fighting for what is right. The way others \n', 'guided and empowered me on my journey – I just want to be able to do the same \n', 'thing for other youth. I want to help those who want to get involved be able to see \n', 'their role in the movement.”\n', 'One might wonder, how does such an active youth leader like Mitzi not \n', 'get burned out? Well, she’s figured that out too. “This work in service of climate \n', 'justice doesn’t come from a place of anger for me. It comes from a place of love. \n', 'It comes from my love for the MAPA in the Philippines – for the most vulnerable \n', 'among us.” Surely, the power of love is the most sustainable form of power—and \n', 'it will drive a more united and effective front of youth leaders into environmental \n', 'activism.\n', '“Once upon a time, I conquered,” \n', 'said the climate catastrophe.\n', '“Once upon a time, we changed the story,”\n', ' the climate activists replied.\n', 'Vanessa Nakate\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Get involved with Mitzi’s chapter of the Youth Advocates for Climate \n', 'Action Philippines at yacap.org. \n', 'If you’re not from the Philippines, connect with the global youth climate \n', 'movement at fridaysforfuture.org\n', '143\n'], 'tags': [[144, 'African American stories Civil Rights Movement'], [144, 'civil disobedience'], [144, 'Civil Rights Movement'], [140, 'climate change impact on vulnerable populations'], [140, 'climate change islands'], [142, 'climate education Climate Reality Leadership Corps Training Program'], [139, 'climate justice for Global South MAPA'], [140, 'environmental protectors Lumad Indigenous people'], [140, 'erosion'], [141, 'Fridays for Future Philippines'], [141, 'Fridays for Future Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines (YACAP) and'], [141, 'Global Day of Climate Action'], [141, 'Global South'], [140, 'Indigenous environmental protectors Lumad (Philippines)'], [140, 'Indigenous peoples Lumad (Philippines)'], [139, 'islands climate justice for Global South MAPA'], [144, 'King John Lewis and'], [144, 'Lewis, John'], [140, 'Lumad Indigenous people'], [141, 'MAPA (the Most Affected People and Areas)'], [143, 'Nakate, Vanessa'], [144, 'nonviolent resistance'], [139, 'Philippines'], [144, 'political activism Civil Rights Movement'], [144, 'racism'], [140, 'risks of activism'], [144, 'risks of activism'], [140, 'sea-level rise'], [139, 'Tan, Mitzi Jonelle'], [139, 'women and girls environmental justice activists'], [141, 'Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines (YACAP)']]}, '27': {'person': 'U.S. Representative John Lewis', 'title': 'Get Into Good Trouble!', 'start_page_number': '144', 'end_page_number': '147', 'story': None}, '28': {'person': 'Destiny Hodges', 'title': 'Generation Green', 'start_page_number': '147', 'end_page_number': '152', 'story': ['Generation Green\n', 'Destiny Hodges | Washington, DC\n', 'Not too far down the street from where Destiny Hodges’s grandmother lives \n', 'in Demopolis, Alabama, there is a paper mill. As a child, Destiny would see the \n', 'smoke rising from the factory towers in long white columns. It gave the air around \n', '147\n', 'her a funny smell. She would cover her nose, hold her breath, and wonder where \n', 'that stench was coming from.\n', '“I looked into it, and I found out that there’s all kinds of carbon monoxide \n', 'and stuff in there that everyone in the community is breathing,” she says. “I think \n', 'about the health of the people who live around there. It’s just terrible.” This left \n', 'a lasting impression on her, that would one day lead her to a life-changing career \n', 'decision.\n', 'Destiny Hodges has been a writer for as long as she can remember. She \n', 'started by writing poetry, but when she went to middle school, she found a new \n', 'passion: journalism. Every Friday in her last class period, her peers led a live \n', 'broadcast. Destiny would watch the small monitor molded to the wall of the \n', 'school’s studio, and watch the video stream. “And I was like—I want to do that!” \n', 'Destiny said. “So I became the producer, and then an anchor, and reporter on the \n', 'show. I loved it all.”\n', 'It was an exciting beginning for Destiny’s career in journalism. Then, when \n', 'she was ready for high school, her family moved to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Destiny \n', 'joined the school’s newspaper, the Northridge Reporter, and was quickly promoted \n', 'to news editor. She wrote about issues of identity and race, as well as her high \n', 'school’s sports teams and musicals. Then one day in May of 2016 she was forced \n', 'to leave her high school—and her beloved newspaper. She pleaded with the ad-\n', 'ministration to let her stay; she was happy there, and she was an integral member \n', 'of the news team. “They just pushed the Black kids, for the most part, back to the \n', 'other side of the river,” Destiny says. “What’s happening in Tuscaloosa is, they are \n', 'resegregating schools. And they’re redlining.”\n', 'Destiny was assigned to Brown High School, a predominantly Black school. \n', 'Although she was promised that her new school would start a journalism program, \n', 'Destiny soon found out what that really meant.\n', '“The teacher who was supposed to teach it was informed that I would handle \n', 'the newspaper. She never had any journalism experience, never taught journal-\n', 'ism,” Destiny said. “That’s the day I found out I was going to really have to start \n', 'from scratch.”\n', 'In order to get the newspaper going, Destiny invited students from her old \n', 'school’s newspaper to give talks to students at her new school who wanted to be \n', 'involved. And she captured what she had learned in writing for the Northridge \n', 'Reporter in Power Point presentations and worksheets so she could share it with \n', 'students at her new school. It was hard work, but it paid off: there were some \n', 'good writers, and some students had a good feeling for design. But most of all, the \n', ' 148\n', 'students appreciated having the chance to see their own stories featured in their \n', 'own newspaper.\n', '“I’ve always said that everybody has a story to tell,” Destiny says. “I’m a giver. \n', 'I’m an empath. This wasn’t about me; it was about providing people with the \n', 'opportunity to explore a new career path.”\n', 'Many students in her high school came from difficult backgrounds, and \n', 'there was no real outlet for them, no one to tell their stories to. “The education \n', 'system in general is not meant for Black students,” Destiny says. “It’s not designed \n', 'for us, or by us.”\n', 'Destiny had also realized there was a lack of reporting on environmental \n', 'stories, like the stench emanating from the paper mill by her grandmother’s \n', 'house. She had always been fascinated by environmental stories, and she watched \n', 'National Geographic’s Animal Planet show almost every day. She knew a little bit \n', 'about climate change, but now she started to wonder who were the people that \n', 'were being the most affected. And where were their voices? “They don’t even \n', 'talk about people like me,” she says. “Usually, we’re impacted first and most by \n', 'everything.”\n', 'It was then that she discovered her passion for covering issues of environ-\n', 'mental justice. She wanted to tell the stories of those communities that were im-\n', 'pacted first, and worst, by climate change. “I made it my mission to do whatever \n', 'I could to use media as a form of narrative organizing,” she says. “To share the \n', 'stories of people from marginalized communities who were being impacted by \n', 'environmental inequity.”\n', 'Environmental issues are often reported on as a matter of protecting the \n', 'natural environment. For Destiny, that is short sighted, and incomplete. “We \n', 'need to broaden our awareness and look at how our health is being impacted by \n', 'environmental factors like clean air and water,” she says. “When we talk about \n', 'natural disasters, like Hurricane Katrina, we need to think about who lives in \n', 'those regions, and who is being impacted the worst; it is primarily people of color.”\n', 'The even greater injustice is that although people of color are dispropor-\n', 'tionately affected by climate change, they have historically been excluded from the \n', 'environmental movement, Destiny says. So when she entered Howard University, \n', 'a historically Black institution in Washington, DC, to study journalism and envi-\n', 'ronmental studies, she was on a mission.\n', 'Right then, all around the world, climate strikes were happening. People \n', 'everywhere were expressing their concerns. Destiny closely followed the fires in \n', 'the Amazon on social media, and she felt so bad for the Indigenous people of \n', '149\n', 'color who were on the front lines of this disaster, breathing toxic fumes, while also \n', 'losing their homes and their loved ones.\n', '“I could see that at Howard, people weren’t necessarily connecting the dots \n', 'to the larger picture,” she says. “And I was like, you know what? We need a climate \n', 'strike here.”\n', 'She started by designing a flyer. Then she set up a social media site, shared it \n', 'in a couple of groups, and urged people to sign up. “People responded, and they \n', 'were actually really curious about it,” she says.\n', 'On the Howard campus, there were a lot of misgivings about the school’s \n', 'sustainability policies. There was an Office for Sustainability for a while, but \n', 'no one ever heard anything coming out of there. “Of course, protesting at the \n', 'national level or at your local government is important,” Destiny says. “But we \n', 'wanted to do it on campus because that’s where we knew we could make an \n', 'impact firsthand.”\n', 'The protest didn’t go quite as planned: one week before students took to the \n', 'streets, the administration invited Destiny and her fellow students to a meeting. \n', 'They had developed an impressive 50-page document detailing their demands. \n', 'The University’s administration sat down with them and listened to what they \n', 'had to say. It became clear that it wasn’t a lack of will; it was actually a lack of \n', 'resources, and not enough communication that had caused the students to have a \n', 'negative perception of their university’s commitment to sustainability.\n', 'But realizing solutions for more sustainability on campus isn’t always easy.\n', '“There’s a lot of things that are considered the norm in sustainability for \n', 'other campuses,” Destiny says. “However, with the financial burdens placed on \n', 'historically Black colleges and universities, it’s not easy to do.”\n', 'With two other students that Destiny met at the protests on campus, she \n', 'founded the Howard University Student Sustainability Committee. They were \n', 'able to facilitate conversations about sustainability on campus, and came up with a \n', 'number of proposals. “We came up with ideas for improved recycling in residence \n', 'halls, and ways of enriching the entire university curriculum with environmen-\n', 'talism and sustainability,” she said. They got in touch with different departments \n', 'in the university to discuss and plan environmentally friendly projects. They also \n', 'created a database of scholarships and internships focused on environmental and \n', 'sustainability issues, gave presentations about climate justice, and organized com-\n', 'munity cleanups. “We got to where we are by speaking up for what we believe in \n', 'and standing together.”\n', ' 150\n', 'As she continued to engage with her community on the issues of sustain-\n', 'ability and climate change, Destiny realized that there weren’t many young Black \n', 'environmental activists, and those who were out there hardly knew each other. \n', 'That is why she decided to start her own nongovernmental organization, Gener-\n', 'ation Green.\n', '“The purpose is to build a network to uplift us so that people can share re-\n', 'sources with each other, and help each other out.” Generation Green is planning \n', 'urban gardening projects, designing sustainable fashion, and planning an interna-\n', 'tional exchange program to give students the opportunity to connect with activists \n', 'in other parts of the world.\n', '“If our students are mostly low-income students, and our communities are \n', 'impacted first, and the worst, by environmental inequity, then why aren’t we en-\n', 'couraging them to go into this field and create innovative solutions to help our \n', 'communities?” she says. “Engaging and implementing effective solutions can’t \n', 'happen without the knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and expertise of those \n', 'who have experienced it, or who are going through it.”\n', 'From time to time Destiny remembers how she used to ask her mom what \n', 'caused that horrible smell when they would drive by the paper mill close to her \n', 'grandmother’s house. “I don’t know,” her mom would say. “Whatever byproduct \n', 'of the paper that they’re making.”\n', 'Soon, with journalists like Destiny reporting to their communities on the \n', 'frontlines of climate change, everyone will know the answers to these questions. \n', 'Then, Destiny’s Generation Green will do something about it!\n', 'It really boils down to this: that all life is interrelated.

At the \n', 'Beacon School, she created an Environmental Club and rallied her classmates to \n', 'join her in the upcoming climate strike on March 15. “I did everything I could. I \n', 'organized. I did graphic designing. I put up flyers; they’d get taken down every \n', 'day. I’d put up more,” she says. “I even got my teachers to understand what we \n', 'were protesting. They understood.

Her new venture, Re-Earth Initia-\n', 'tive, focuses on radical inclusivity, diversity, and accountability through workshops, \n', 'toolkits, and webinars. She is especially passionate about increasing awareness of \n', 'the importance of reciprocity and intersectionality in the global youth climate \n', 'movement.\n', '153\n', 'A powerful public speaker, Xiye has gained a reputation for her ability to \n', 'inspire climate action. At the Global Citizens Festival in 2019, she spoke about \n', 'the intersection of climate change with human rights issues, which many people \n', 'outside of activist circles don’t yet understand. “We haven’t thought too much \n', 'about the effect the climate crisis is having on refugees.” Xiye says. “But the dis-\n', 'placement of people is an inevitable consequence of the climate crisis. And it’s not \n', 'just that the climate crisis will create climate refugees; it’s already happening!” Re-\n', 'flecting back to her own personal story, she educates people about how extended \n', 'periods of drought result in instability of crops, and force people away from their \n', 'ancestral lands. And when there are irregular flooding patterns, people must seek \n', 'shelter elsewhere. “We need not only to mitigate these issues, but to adapt, with \n', 'well-structured systems and policy to deal with climate refugees.”\n', 'For Xiye, UN Sustainable Development Goal #17 is the most important \n', 'goal: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sus-\n', 'tainable development, since it has the capacity to link people, goals, and places of \n', 'all kinds in service of a broader, sustainable world. “Partnerships are a necessity. \n', 'Cooperation is the key,” she says. “We need for people to not focus just on one \n', 'goal without thinking about all the others. Having all kinds of people from all \n', 'types of background is what will make this possible.”\n', 'Xiye also speaks out on educational platforms like TED Talks to inform \n', 'people about the climate crisis. “TED has become a great advocate for climate \n', 'education with its Countdown,” she explains. “A lot of businesses are shifting their \n', 'whole way of thinking to be more sustainable. And when educational networks \n', 'partake in community building around these issues, it creates a really cohesive \n', 'coalition going forward.”\n', 'Xiye gave a memorable TED Talk, which was framed as a letter to her abue-\n', 'la, her grandmother. “The world is so big, and it has so many bad habits,” she said. \n', '“I didn’t know how a 15-year-old was supposed to change anything, but I had to \n', 'try.” Reflecting back on her speech she says, “It was a way to share my story, my \n', 'frustration, my hopes and dreams for the future in a new way that I hoped would \n', 'influence people, because what we need is more people supporting this movement. \n', 'We especially need more youth to be involved as climate activists. If there were \n', 'more of us, none of us would have to be full-time activists.”\n', 'Wherever Xiye goes, she finds youth eager to get involved but they don’t \n', 'know how or where to start. For them, she has some guidance. “It doesn’t matter \n', 'what your gift or passion is in life. We need youth from all walks, because diversity \n', 'of thinking and skills is what is going to make solutions possible. Any skill that \n', ' 154\n', 'you have can be used to address the climate crisis; whether you are an architect, \n', 'photographer, educator, scientist, or activist, we could use your skills because we \n', 'need all the skills to face up to this emergency.”\n', 'That said, she cautions youth to avoid the pressure to change who they are \n', 'to fit into a particular role. “Be who you are, know yourself, and ask yourself what \n', 'you can add,” she says. “If you don’t find anything that fits you, just Google a \n', 'cause that you are interested in supporting and get involved. If there’s nothing, \n', 'come up with it yourself. It’s true that a lot of times there are no spaces for us at \n', 'the table to share our voices and opinions. And if you can’t find a seat at the table, \n', 'just build your own table! You will make an impact, because youth always do. We \n', 'have more influence than we think we do, and we need to take advantage of that.”\n', 'For adults, Xiye doesn’t necessarily want support for the youth as much as \n', 'she wants support for the overall climate movement. “The youth grow really fast. \n', 'I started out at 15, and in a snap of my fingers, I’m 19. And I’ve left my youth \n', 'behind. I had a lot of great things to say as a youth, and I was heard by plenty of \n', 'adults. But what it boils down to is that the youth can’t vote. So when adults work \n', 'to amplify the demands of youth, to be heard in their circles of influence, that’s \n', 'great, and we are grateful for that.

She quickly realized the scale and severity of \n', 'the environmental problems Argentina was facing. She learned about the role of \n', 'climate change in creating more severe heat waves and longer, more devastating \n', 'droughts—which were responsible for the fires that in 2020 burned over 1 million \n', 'acres of land, and nearly another 100,000 acres in 2021 in Argentina.

Greta Thunberg got me thinking that we should try to create a \n', 'movement in Argentina.”\n', 'So she formed Jovenes Por El Clima–Youth for Climate Argentina (YFCA)—\n', 'to engage young Argentinians who were concerned about climate change to join \n', 'with Greta and young activists around the world who were bringing the spotlight \n', 'to the youth movement. In September 2019, for the first Global Climate Strike, \n', 'YFCA organized climate rallies of 5,000, 10,000, and 45,000 people, across Ar-\n', 'gentina. “It wasn’t easy to pull it off.

It was the first nation in Latin America to do so, and it set \n', 'the stage for wide-sweeping reforms in the country.

There was domestic violence in her \n', 'family; gang violence in her community; police violence in the streets that often \n', '159\n', 'targeted her family members, specifically her older brothers, because of the way \n', 'they looked. Drug and alcohol abuse negatively impacted families, and racism \n', 'often showed up in their contact with police, and in high school.\n', 'Then, right before her 17th birthday, Carmen’s older sister was killed in a \n', 'one vehicular car accident. Her sister and Carmen were one day and two years \n', 'apart, and she was killed right before her 19th birthday, and buried on Carmen’s \n', '17th birthday.\n', 'Carmen’s relationship with her sister had been challenging. While Carmen \n', 'focused on sports and schoolwork, her sister got involved in hanging out with \n', 'the wrong crowd, which led to tension at home. Often having to chaperone her \n', 'sister, Carmen would stick to the sidelines, dribbling her basketball and not saying \n', 'much. But they were close in age, shared a room and a very special bond that was \n', 'unbreakable.\n', 'Her sister’s death put everything into perspective for Carmen. “She went \n', 'out with her friends one night and never came back home,” she says. “That be-\n', 'came the catalyst that changed my life, and is what made me want to change the \n', 'world.

There, she suddenly found herself exposed to a different \n', 'sort of crowd—one where both privilege and resistance came together in different \n', 'ways. She enrolled in a class on Chicana feminism, and studied with some of the \n', 'great activists and scholars of the protest and feminist movements: Aida Hurtado, \n', 'Angela Davis, Craig Haney, and others.\n', 'Unlike many of her peers, Carmen had to pay her own way through college \n', 'by working multiple jobs. But this opened up unexpected opportunities. She began \n', 'to work at the Youth Community Restoration Project, where she helped mentor \n', 'young people coming out of the justice system by getting them jobs and creating \n', ' 160\n', 'leadership opportunities for them. She also cofounded Girlzpace, which provided \n', 'gender-responsive services for girls in the community. Ultimately she went on to \n', 'work at the Santa Cruz County Probation Department to serve girls within the \n', 'system, and do system accountability. Like Carmen, some of the girls had a vision \n', 'of a different sort of future for themselves—one not defined by violence, but by \n', 'resistance to it.\n', 'Through this work Carmen came into contact with the organization Barrios \n', 'Unidos, and its founder, Nane Alejandrez. Nane had founded the organization \n', 'in 1977, and he had a radical idea: instead of isolating and locking up young \n', 'people who had committed crimes, he said, we should listen to them and support \n', 'them with the tools to succeed. Returning from Vietnam, where he had seen the \n', 'injustice and cruelty of war firsthand, he saw injustice echoed at home through \n', 'mass incarceration. Thirty-five members of his family had been behind bars—an \n', 'entire generation locked up and forgotten.\n', 'Nane saw a spark in Carmen; he brought her on board, and became some-\n', 'thing of a father figure and mentor for her. He was a humble and fair person, and \n', 'expected a lot from her, but he also supported her and knew she was destined for \n', 'greatness. “I was able to really learn from him,” she says. “He didn’t have to tell \n', 'me what his ideology was or what his theory of change was; you could see it in his \n', 'mannerisms, in the way in which he lived, and led.”\n', 'For example, when Nane would be invited to be a keynote speaker some-\n', 'where, he wouldn’t be on stage waiting for the guests to come in, but in the aisles \n', 'welcoming them, as an usher would. Nane embodied servant leadership, and Car-\n', 'men saw how people responded to this kind of warmth, which led her to bring it \n', 'to her own work later on.\n', 'During the 1990s the need for organizing around criminal justice issues was \n', 'increasing in the United States. The War on Drugs saw the prison population sky-\n', 'rocket across the country, and communities like Carmen’s were the most affected. \n', 'She made it her mission to right these wrongs, and fight against the injustice she \n', 'saw.\n', 'One day Nane introduced Carmen to one of his mentors, Harry Belafonte, \n', 'who was partnering with him on prison reform for black and brown youth. The \n', 'beloved Jamaican singer and actor, a friend of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was \n', 'a legend in the Civil Rights movement. He had raised millions of dollars by en-\n', 'gaging other celebrities to perform at his fundraisers. His generosity was so pure, \n', 'and so unwavering, that Coretta Scott King, an activist in her own right, said, \n', '“Whenever we got into trouble, or when tragedy struck, Harry has always come to \n', '161\n', 'our aid, his generous heart wide open.”\n', 'When Harry and Carmen met, they immediately hit it off. Soon after, Harry \n', 'asked Carmen to join his organization, The Gathering for Justice, as a founding \n', 'member, and move to New York City. The Gathering for Justice grounded com-\n', 'munities in the ideology of Dr. King—Kingian Nonviolence—and was embark-\n', 'ing on building a national movement to end child incarceration.\n', 'The introduction to Mr. Belafonte brought Carmen’s activism to a whole \n', 'new level, and gave her the opportunity to fight for real, structural change in com-\n', 'munities across the country that had long suffered from inequity, discrimination, \n', 'and the legacies of racism and slavery. But she never lost sight of the lessons she \n', 'had learned from Nane. “The movement is not about one individual, it’s about \n', 'building collective power,” she says. “There are times when even though you’ve \n', 'not done something, it is your responsibility as a moral leader to repair the harm \n', 'that’s been done.”\n', 'Carmen’s star as an activist was on the rise after she founded Justice League \n', 'NYC, a manifestation of The Gathering for Justice, when in 2014 another tragedy \n', 'struck, and moved her activism into another arena. That summer, she went to Fer-\n', 'guson, Missouri, where a week earlier, an unarmed black man, Michael Brown Jr., \n', 'had been shot by police, sparking protests that would eventually spread across the \n', 'city, and the nation. When she landed in Ferguson, the August heat was oppressive, \n', 'ominous. That day, her phone rang: it was a call from back home. Her nephew, \n', 'just 22 years old, had cancer. “That became the second catalyst for me,” she says. \n', '“It gave me this sense of urgency, and again the feeling that life was too short.”\n', 'In Oxnard, which is one of the country’s top strawberry-picking regions, \n', 'pesticides sprayed by large-scale fruit farms waft across the countryside and into \n', 'the respiratory systems of the people who live, work, and go to school there. Al-\n', 'though it is not known how her nephew got cancer, the school that he attended is \n', 'right across the road from one of these farms. Breathing those toxic fumes was not \n', 'healthy for anyone who lived nearby.\n', 'Latinx farmworkers in California have long fought for the state to recognize \n', 'the harm inflicted upon them by agricultural practices. They took their case to \n', 'court, suing the California Department of Pesticide Regulation for discrimination, \n', 'because the chemicals that are sprayed disproportionately affect Latinx commu-\n', 'nities. After a decade-long battle, they won; and the Environmental Protection \n', 'Agency was forced to restrict its chemical use.\n', 'Carmen’s nephew’s illness, and his daily fight to live forced Carmen to real-\n', 'ize that invisible, insidious attacks on the environment can play just as big a role \n', ' 162\n', 'in perpetuating inequity as overt violence and discrimination. “When I got the \n', 'news about my nephew, I realized that this movement was not just about criminal \n', 'justice reform, or police brutality,” she says. “It’s about environmental justice. It’s \n', 'about immigration reform. It’s about all these other things that impact us all.”\n', '“One of the teachings from Barrios Unidos that we talk about is honoring \n', 'Mother Earth, and also honoring our spirit,” she says. “It’s all interconnected. \n', 'It’s all valuable.

But \n', 'her message to potential activists from across the country is simple: that little girl \n', 'could be you.\n', 'She sees a new generation of activists coming of age and bringing their \n', 'own passion to causes across the board. “Whether it’s climate justice, immigration \n', 'reform, criminal justice reform, violence prevention, Black Lives Matter, whatever \n', 'it may be, there’s a lane for them,” she says. “Young people should always re-\n', 'member that their voice is powerful, and they have always been at the forefront of \n', 'every movement in America.

Her mother, Felicia Davis, was \n', 'working in the sustainability field: she would often bring home magazines from \n', 'work with articles about global warming and climate change. Illai was intrigued, \n', 'and she was always curious to learn more—and find ways she could get involved \n', 'to help remedy the situation. But at school, when she read her science textbooks, \n', 'she didn’t find much about these issues.\n', 'Illai was troubled. She knew that Black communities like hers are the most \n', 'negatively impacted by global warming and climate change. And as a young per-\n', 'son, she was outraged that the planet, and her right to a healthy, sustainable future, \n', 'was being ruined by decisions made by an older generation disconnected from her \n', 'reality. “We are the ones who are going to be the most impacted by the decisions \n', 'being made today,” she said. “But what recourse do we children have? We can’t \n', 'vote. We can’t run for office.” Thinking back on it now, years later, she says, “It \n', ' 168\n', 'was a daunting realization to come to.”\n', 'So, at age 12, Illai and her friends created the nonprofit organization, Geor-\n', 'gia Kids Against Pollution (KAP), to do something about it. She wanted to be a \n', 'bridge between her friends and those who were engaged with more visible social \n', 'issues, like gun violence and voting rights, than with environmental activism.\n', 'Illai had grown up around community organizing, and had seen how pro-\n', 'testing can help people get their voices heard. “I had a knack for finding common \n', 'ground. And I did a lot of organizing,” she says. Still, she needed a little guidance. \n', '“So we went to the adults in our lives, who helped us flesh out our ideas, and \n', 'prepare us for some of the challenges we would meet with KAP. The environment \n', 'was affecting us, giving young kids in our neighborhood asthma. These things \n', 'were affecting us, but we really didn’t understand,” she says. “Things like carbon \n', 'dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and mercury, were being put out into the air by power \n', 'plants and major pollutants. They cause smog; they cause global warming; they \n', 'cause acid rain, which in turn affects us. These power plants dump pollutants into \n', 'low-income areas.” And she added, “Somebody needs to let the people who live \n', 'there know that yes, you do have a choice; you aren’t forced to live with this stuff. \n', 'And you can make a difference if you want to.”\n', 'In 2003, when she was just 13 years old, Illai led the first KAP protest, held \n', 'outside of the Southern Company, a gas and utility corporation based in Geor-\n', 'gia. “Our demonstration actually made it into the shareholders report,” she says \n', 'proudly. “This gigantic corporation actually heard our concerns about alternative \n', 'energy. At the time, I didn’t realize it was such an effective action.” She smiles, and \n', 'adds, “I started small. And I still haven’t let up in the fight.”\n', 'That same year, Illai received the prestigious Brower Youth Award, which \n', 'is given each year to six youth environmental leaders across the country. “Despite \n', 'the struggles of organizing, that really gave me validation,” she says. The following \n', 'year, Illai joined her mother at the U.N. Conference on Sustainable Development \n', 'in Johannesburg, South Africa. She was eager to learn about how people around \n', 'the world were being affected by environmental issues, and what they were doing \n', 'to find solutions. “At the conference, I saw firsthand how communities of color \n', 'face the same issues wherever we are on the planet; economic issues, social justice \n', 'issues, environmental issues.” She adds, “Environmental issues are often the last \n', 'ones to be talked about.”\n', 'The visibility from the Brower Youth Award led to a nonprofit organization, \n', 'Corporate Accountability International, reaching out to Illai when she was 16. \n', 'They wanted to partner with her on some advocacy work at a Coca Cola interna-\n', '169\n', 'tional shareholder’s meeting. Illai spoke on behalf of farmers in India who were \n', 'having their local groundwater supplies devastated by the company. She asked a \n', 'roomful of shareholders what they planned to do when young people refused to \n', 'buy Coca-Cola due to their abusive water practices in India. Shortly thereafter or-\n', 'ganizers succeeded in getting Coca Cola to shut down two of the most predatory \n', 'plants in India, which were impoverishing local communities. “Getting involved \n', 'with shareholder advocacy opened up a new world of ways to engage civically,” \n', 'she says. “Today it’s a common tactic, but back then, there wasn’t much conversa-\n', 'tion around this sort of engagement.”\n', 'When it was time for college, Illai chose Howard University, her mother’s \n', 'alma mater, in Washington, DC as the place she wanted to further her studies in \n', 'communications. While at Howard, she interned with the university’s Office of \n', 'Sustainability. That’s when she discovered the gaping holes in support for sustain-\n', 'able development among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), \n', 'especially around tech, solar energy, and green education issues. “The expertise \n', 'that a lot of universities take for granted—HBCUs just don’t have access to that,” \n', 'she says. So she set about changing that too, step by step, as she always had.\n', 'As a project manager in the Office of Sustainability Illai helped support \n', 'projects like the installation of solar panels on buildings at Howard; green energy \n', 'retrofits around the campus; the formation of a full- scale recycling program; and \n', 'an organic garden with a composting program. Each of these projects was a huge \n', 'step toward creating a more sustainable university. However, each project was \n', 'also a standalone project. This awareness challenged Illai to think about bigger \n', 'questions concerning the nature of longer-term sustainable growth.\n', 'In partnership with her mother, Illai cofounded the HBCU Green Fund, to \n', 'create a capital infrastructure for long-term sustainable growth projects to gener-\n', 'ate money for HBCUs. Their strategy is to support projects that reduce energy \n', 'and water usage on HBCU campuses – which creates financial savings, which \n', 'are then reinvested into more sustainable projects and infrastructure. Illai hopes \n', 'that it will also inspire a whole new generation of African American students to \n', 'appreciate the value of green living.\n', 'In all of her successes, Illai is always quick to recognize the tremendous \n', 'legacy she inherited from her family, who were among the most forward- think-\n', 'ing environmentalists, at a time when such thinking was in its infancy. “My \n', 'great-grandmother was the greatest conservationist and communicator,” she says. \n', '“She mastered so many of the strategies that are just now becoming common—re-\n', 'cycling, urban agriculture, living simply, investing wisely—and also, the power of \n', ' 170\n', 'proactive community engagement.”\n', 'Illai’s mother, Felicia Davis, continues to be a leading voice for advancing \n', 'sustainability in the HBCU community and beyond. At the United Negro College \n', 'Fund, she has created impactful projects like the Building Green Initiative, which \n', 'has helped Black, Hispanic-serving, and tribal colleges move toward a more sus-\n', 'tainable future. In the early 2000s, Felicia carried on her family’s legacy when she \n', 'started a network of eco-cyber centers in rural Ghana, South Africa, and Senegal. \n', 'She has also used technology to create powerful cultural exchanges and environ-\n', 'mental stewardship programs, through projects like beach and village cleanups.\n', 'This dynamic mother and daughter duo are frequent spokespersons who \n', 'represent communities of color at predominantly white conferences like Project \n', 'Drawdown. They also ensure that they are not the only Black voices in white spac-\n', 'es by securing funding for other Black leaders to join them. “While there’s a legacy \n', 'that runs down from my great- grandmother, to my mother, to me, that sense of \n', 'stewardship is not only for my family, or my community alone. It should extend \n', 'out globally in our actions, far beyond ourselves and our own communities.”\n', 'For youth who want to pursue a path in sustainability, Illai has some practi-\n', 'cal advice. “What I tend to tell young people is that every day, we all make choices. \n', 'And the worlds we create are a reflection of the choices we make.” Responsible \n', 'choices create responsible individuals – and ultimately, this creates responsible \n', 'communities.\n', 'Illai wants young people to understand how their actions can reach far be-\n', 'yond wherever they started. In her eyes, it’s important to be informed about what \n', 'you want to pursue as a youth, because knowledge leads to better choices, and \n', 'better choices lead to empowerment. By educating yourself as much as possible, \n', 'you are also creating a person that is resilient. This is important, especially for \n', 'Black youth and communities of color, in a time when we are constantly sur-\n', 'rounded by overwhelming amounts of conflicting information, and we face the \n', 'constant existential threats from police brutality and structural racism. In these \n', 'trying times, we need more youth and adult leaders to make space for those who \n', 'are most impacted by these issues.\n', 'Illai, ever the practical leader, says that she could give us a long story, or a \n', 'big lesson, to try to get the legacy of sustainability that her family has embodied \n', 'across to others.

I got \n', 'to see how excited people were to cast their vote. For many of them it was the \n', 'first vote they had ever cast in their lives that really mattered.” For over 30 years, \n', 'Kenya had been ruled by the Kenya African National Union (KANU), in a one \n', 'party system. Until that fateful day, the people of Kenya had no say in their future.\n', 'When Scott was 8 years old his father joined the State Department. His \n', 'family left their home in San Diego to experience the world. Frequent travel was \n', 'part and parcel of growing up for Scott. He was constantly moving about, expe-\n', 'riencing different people, languages, cultures, and most importantly, systems of \n', 'government. By the time he was 16, he had been all around the United States and \n', 'Latin America. It’s been said that travel helps create a charitable mind. He credits \n', 'his most formative experiences to living on the African continent.\n', '“When you are living in a place without a democracy, things can be scary. \n', 'People see that the democratic effort is towards good. But they doubt that a de-\n', 'mocracy could actually thrive, since it never had.”\n', 'Scott would hold these lessons close to his heart; the main one being, democ-\n', 'racy is fragile. This is something he wasn’t taught in school when he was young, \n', 'and it troubled him, considering how important a concept this was. From that \n', 'point forward, he made it his mission in life to ensure that more young people in \n', 'the United States were civically educated and engaged.\n', 'When Scott returned to the U.S., he attended Brown University. Here, he \n', 'immediately got interested in learning all that he could about international poli-\n', 'tics on campus. By the end of his senior year, he felt like he had the tools to start \n', 'a civic movement of his own.\n', '183\n', '“A lot of young people want to make a difference, but don’t necessarily see \n', 'politics and local government as the best way to do so. There are a whole host of \n', 'reasons for this. And people can be cynical about politics. But I think the main \n', 'reason is that young people don’t understand how these systems work – because \n', 'we don’t teach civics in schools anymore. And when we do, it’s boring. It’s like - \n', 'how a bill becomes a law, that kind of approach.”\n', 'So it made Scott wonder, how do we bring civics back to the classroom? \n', 'How do we get young people excited about participating in a democracy? We \n', 'need a new approach, and it needs to be action-oriented. It needs to bring young \n', 'people to politics by engaging them in issues they care about. From here, while still \n', 'a senior at Brown, he co-founded with Anna Ninan Generation Citizen (GC) to \n', 'ensure that every student in the United States receives an effective action-oriented \n', 'civics education.\n', 'In September 2008, they had their first success in Rhode Island schools, \n', 'serving 300 students. In a year, they had offices in the Greater Boston area. By \n', '2010, they had won a prestigious Echoing Green Fellowship for their work.\n', '“We work with high schools to ensure that students take action civics, just like \n', 'they would science or math. In our curriculum, they learn about local issues, and \n', 'then take real plans of action to local government. It’s getting at the root cause of \n', 'a problem, and addressing it through the process from start to finish,” Scott adds, \n', '“But it isn’t always easy.”\n', '“I organized my first event when I was 23. We were working with the Provi-\n', 'dence Public School District, and all seemed well. That is, until I realized I messed \n', 'up the bus registration process – and I did. It wasn’t a small error. I was repri-\n', 'manded. I felt incompetent. And more than anything, I felt so bad that an action \n', 'of mine would take away any of the spotlight from these amazing youth leaders. \n', 'It took me a lot of time to rebuild that relationship. But it was important that I \n', 'recognized it was on me, and to get better. There was a bigger cause to serve out \n', 'there.”\n', '“GC is a great organization, but I’ve made many mistakes along the way. \n', 'Going through the ups and downs is what got me where I am today.” Scott recalls \n', 'another struggle he had. It occurred when he was lobbying at the state house of \n', 'Rhode Island for divestment from Sudan, which was suffering from the genocide \n', 'in Darfur. “While I was lobbying on the floor, a treasurer came by and said “this is \n', 'a cute student project,” – they didn’t take me seriously at all. It made me feel like \n', 'I was too young. Like I wasn’t going to succeed. It can be hard to push forward \n', 'without support. But I learned from this experience, and applied it to GC. When \n', ' 184\n', 'you start a nonprofit, there are countless obstacles. You are always worried about \n', 'having enough funds to support your cause, so you are always trying to raise funds. \n', 'Because of this, you are living in a world of rejection, and you have to be able to \n', 'deal with that. It’s hard too, when it seems like more people should care about the \n', 'issue that you care about. Having a greater cause in mind helps.”\n', 'Scott describes the culmination of Generation Citizen’s curriculum, where \n', 'students really have the chance to shine. “We have a Civics Day that takes place \n', 'at the end of the Fall and Spring semesters in each of our program sites. It’s \n', 'kind of like a science fair for civics, where our students present their action civics \n', 'projects to the community, local officials, and community leaders who bridge the \n', 'gap between them. It’s a great place to see young people taking civic action.”\n', 'GC has a policy and advocacy component. It tries to ensure that action civ-\n', 'ics is a need- to-have in curriculums across the nation. A major advocacy issue of \n', 'GC is their push for legislation to lower the voting age to 16. Scott believes that if \n', 'younger people were going to be voting, schools would be much more motivated \n', 'to properly provide civics education. “Our country has dismal voter participation, \n', 'especially recently,” says Scott adding, “Lowering the voting age is a necessary \n', 'reform that’s needed for spurring higher voter participation, more education, and \n', 'more civic engagement.”\n', 'This year alone, 30,000 students across the country have been engaged in \n', 'action civics with GC. With offices in New York, Oakland, Massachusetts, Rhode \n', 'Island, California, Oklahoma, and Texas, it might be easy to think Scott was an \n', 'instant success. But this isn’t the case.\n', 'Scott wants young people to know one thing about themselves – they hold a \n', 'great amount of power. “Every time we have seen a positive change in this coun-\n', 'try, youth have been at the forefront. Whether it was the Civil Rights Movement, \n', 'or Climate Change Advocacy, the youth have led the way where others wouldn’t. \n', 'So I believe it’s up to young people to build a better democracy than the one we \n', 'have today.”\n', 'And he has all the faith in the world that they will. Especially when they are \n', 'supported by strong adult leadership. “For too long, we’ve heard it said that young \n', 'people have to wait their turn. We’ve heard that they don’t have anything valuable \n', 'to add to a conversation. We’ve heard that young people should wait until they are \n', 'older, when they can really understand the way things work. To this sort of think-\n', 'ing? Well, I would just say that we need more of the unique knowledge that young \n', 'people have out there. We need to hear more of their points of view. More of \n', 'their abilities to unify people. And we need to support them now, more than ever.”\n', '185\n', 'In all of his work, Scott has demonstrated an amazing capacity to unify \n', 'people through civic education. GC has acted as a bridge between organizations, \n', 'and has brought many differing causes together. With its Community Change \n', 'Fellowship, GC has funded students to partner with causes around the country. \n', 'Those include YouthUprising (Bay Area), Make The Road New York, and the \n', 'Boston Education Justice Alliance.\n', 'GC has countless alumni still making an impact by carrying on the tenets of \n', 'civic education.

These lakes would then overflow, causing more flash floods \n', 'and mudslides, which have already displaced thousands of people. “None of the \n', 'communities in Nepal are safe,” says Shreya. “All of them are vulnerable to the \n', 'impacts of climate change.”\n', 'The poverty level is comparatively high in Nepal. And while most people \n', 'have noticed a change in the weather patterns, few know about the underlying \n', 'causes. “Most of the people here don’t know about these things,” Shreya says. \n', '“They don’t know about the climate crisis, and they don’t know what we should be \n', 'doing to protect the environment.”\n', 'Shreya started searching for solutions, and stories about people who were \n', 'standing up and fighting for the future of our planet. “I studied what we can do \n', 'as individuals, and especially how we, as young people, can lead,” she says. “This \n', 'really inspired me.”\n', 'Then she learned about the 6th National Youth Conference on Climate \n', 'Change, organized by Nepalese Youth for Climate Action (NYCA), together with \n', 'the United Nation Development Program (UNDP). She promptly filled out the \n', 'application form and sent it in. The following week she heard that she’d been \n', 'rejected. But Shreya isn’t one to give up easily. “Not a problem,” she thought, \n', 'and she gave the conference organizers a call. She let them know that if someone \n', 'dropped out, she would love to attend. Much to her delight, on the very same \n', 'day, another participant decided not to come, and Shreya was officially invited to \n', 'attend the conference.\n', '“I met all sorts of people there. It gave me hope that yes, we can do something, \n', 'even though climate change is a global problem,” she says. “If we act locally, and \n', 'if we act in solidarity with others in our own communities, then of course we can \n', 'do something!”\n', 'Inspired by the young people at the conference, Shreya started volunteer-\n', 'ing with NYCA. At the same time, she found a position teaching environmental \n', 'science in a local school. For her, this was a perfect opportunity to engage young \n', 'people in the issues that were close to her heart. “I helped the children develop a \n', 'better appreciation for nature, how to understand the importance of preserving a \n', 'balance,” she says. “We talked about caring for our resources—water, air, and life; \n', 'and of course we talked about global warming and the climate crisis.”\n', 'For Shreya, the best way to learn is by doing. So she set up a club at her \n', 'school, where children could engage in all kinds of hands-on activities.\n', ' 188\n', 'They planted trees, and learned how to properly separate waste. “We dis-\n', 'covered together that each of our actions matters, whether it is small or large, \n', 'whether it has a big impact or not,” Shreya says. “It was truly inspiring.”\n', 'For the first project she organized with NYCA, Shreya wanted to help the \n', 'environment while educating her fellow citizens about the importance of envi-\n', 'ronmental protection. She brought together 60 people, and they traveled together \n', 'down a road that was particularly littered. For the next three weeks, they picked \n', 'up trash and talked with the people who lived along the street. They also reached \n', 'out to the local shop owners and talked with them about environmentally harmful \n', 'practices, like burning trash out in the open. “We just connected with the people \n', 'and explained how a clean community is the foundation for good health—and a \n', 'good economy,” she says. “That was our big first event; that’s how it all started.”\n', 'For Shreya, it was a very rewarding experience. Some days after the clean-\n', 'up campaign, she and two friends were walking through that same area. One \n', 'of her friends, who hadn’t participated in the event, was surprised. “This place \n', 'was so dirty before! Now it’s so nice!” her friend said. “The city must have done \n', 'something here.”\n', '“I was so happy inside,” Shreya says. “Because it wasn’t the city; it was us!” \n', 'Her friend was impressed. “If there is another event in the next weeks, make sure \n', 'to invite me as well!” she said.\n', 'Shreya continued her work with the NYCA, organizing events, educational \n', 'talks, and mobilizing students for climate strikes. They even wrote a letter to the \n', 'Nepalese prime minister, asking him to rethink his energy policy.\n', '“We organize awareness campaigns and conferences, and we advocate for \n', 'environmental policies,” she says. “We meet with those who are responsible, and \n', 'we try to push them to take climate-friendly decisions.”\n', 'Then, in September 2019, Shreya was very interested to learn about Youth \n', 'Climate Scholarships. This organization funds young climate leaders from around \n', 'the world to be representatives at climate conferences. They want young people \n', 'to be able to provide their input into discussions about the Nationally Determined \n', 'Contributions (NDCs), the commitments that countries agreed to under the 2015 \n', 'Paris Climate Agreement. Shreya was eager to go to the COP25 conference in \n', 'Madrid, where this would be discussed. Unfortunately, there was a problem.\n', '“The deadline had already passed,” Shreya says. But again, she wasn’t going \n', 'to give up easily. “I just filled out the form anyway and sent it off.”\n', 'Two weeks later she got an email: she had been selected, along with a hand-\n', '189\n', 'ful of other young climate activists, from more than 20,000 applicants! She was \n', 'so excited that she would be able to travel to Madrid to represent Nepalese youth \n', 'there.\n', '“When I arrived there, it was amazing,” she says. “But it was also very com-\n', 'plicated at first. Since we had been sponsored, we had a specific schedule to follow, \n', 'with all the important meetings we were to attend.”\n', 'But Shreya hadn’t traveled all the way to Madrid to just sit in conferences \n', 'and listen to others speak. “One of my friends from Poland and I were asked to \n', 'give the youth statement at the final plenary session,” she says. “At first I was so \n', 'nervous, because there were leaders there from all over the world, and also from \n', 'my country.”\n', 'The closing session of COP25 had been postponed again and again, and \n', 'Shreya had been sitting there waiting for her turn, all through the night. But there \n', 'was no going back now. “It was clear to us that this was the platform where global \n', 'leaders would finally hear us, the youth,” she says.\n', 'And what did she say when her time to speak finally came? “We want more \n', 'ambitious actions,” she, and the other youth leaders demanded. “There’s more we \n', 'can do at our homes, at local levels through awareness campaigns and inspiring \n', 'people for change.”\n', '“We wanted them to really hear that the COP25 outcomes were just not \n', 'satisfactory to us,” she says now, remembering.\n', 'After her speech, Shreya gave interviews and talked to other COP25 repre-\n', 'sentatives. “They came up to us and told us that they appreciated us speaking up \n', 'and telling the truth,” she says. “Many of the people who work for governments \n', 'and NGOs know that something is wrong, but they cannot speak out because they \n', 'are scared that they might lose their jobs, or their funding.”\n', 'For Shreya, this just goes to show why youth need to be on the frontlines of \n', 'the fight against climate change. “As young people today, we are the most import-\n', 'ant generation that will ever live on earth,” she says. “But we need to recognize \n', 'our responsibility, and we need to acknowledge our power to do something.”\n', 'As people alive today, we must consider future generations: \n', 'a clean environment is a human right like any other.\n', ' It is therefore part of our responsibility toward others to ensure that \n', 'the world we pass on is as healthy, if not healthier, than we found it.\n', 'His Holiness the Dalai Lama\n', ' 190\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Invite your friends to join you in organizing a clean- up campaign in your \n', 'community! \n', 'Visit NYCA: www.nyca.net.np \n', 'Follow Shreya on Twitter @KCShreya\n', 'Read her blog kcshreya.wordpress.com\n'], 'tags': [[187, 'Asia climate change activism'], [189, 'cleanup campaigns'], [188, 'climate change migration due to'], [188, 'climate change activism awareness-building'], [187, 'climate change mountainous regions'], [188, 'climate education in communities/schools'], [189, 'COP climate conferences Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)'], [190, 'COP climate conferences youth dissatisfaction with'], [190, 'Dalai Lama'], [189, 'Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)'], [187, 'Nepal'], [188, 'Nepalese Youth for Climate Action (NYCA)'], [188, 'refugees climate'], [187, 'Shreya K.C.']]}, '39': {'person': 'Angelique Pouponneau', 'title': 'A Voice For Youth & Oceans', 'start_page_number': '191', 'end_page_number': '195', 'story': ['A Voice For Youth & Oceans\n', 'Angelique Pouponneau | Seychelles\n', 'Angelique Pouponneau grew up on Mahé, the largest of the 115 islands \n', 'in Seychelles.

It \n', 'was called Barracuda Lane, and it ran alongside a marsh that was teeming with \n', 'life, with all kinds of little animals crawling around, and insects buzzing through \n', 'the air. She would step out onto the beach, listen to the waves crashing on the sand, \n', 'and breathe in the smell of the ocean breeze.\n', 'When she was 19, Angelique left Seychelles to study law at the University of \n', 'London. It was a very different kind of life there, and soon she realized that there \n', 'were many things that she had always taken for granted. “People used to ask me \n', 'what it was that I missed the most,” she remembers. “I would always say the sea \n', 'breeze.”\n', 'She missed other things, too. In a city like London, where most of the time \n', 'you can’t see further than the next block of housing, she would daydream about \n', 'the infinite view she had known back home, spanning the horizon over the Indian \n', 'Ocean.\n', 'But when Angelique returned to Seychelles after finishing her degree, it \n', 'wasn’t the same anymore. Barracuda Lane was no longer the muddy little path \n', 'that she used to walk down to get to the ocean: it had been turned into a board-\n', 'walk. And there was no longer a marsh full of mudskippers and other insects. In \n', 'its place was a fancy new hotel.

She joined the Small Island Developing \n', 'States Youth AIMS-Hub (SYAH), an organization that had advanced youth-led \n', 'initiatives on sustainable development. She travelled to Mauritius to help set up \n', 'the organization’s regional chapter.

Looking into the audience, he could see his mother clapping along with \n', 'everyone else, wiping tears from her face as he accepted the award. Sitting right \n', 'in front of her was Malala Yousafzai, the young Nobel Peace Prize winner, who \n', 'had just introduced him. It was an emotional high point for Mohamad, part of his \n', 'long journey away from his home in Syria to his new life in Sweden.\n', 'The road that brought Mohamad to this moment had actually begun in \n', 'Lebanon, where he and his family had fled for safety in 2013. Mohamed was 12 \n', 'at the time, and the adjustment was difficult for him. When he, his mother and \n', 'uncle had arrived in Lebanon, they had a house and a roof over their heads, but \n', 'it didn’t feel like home to him. His father had had to stay back in Syria, so Moha-\n', 'mad’s family was torn apart. In Syria, Mohamad’s world had been built around \n', 'his school, his family, and his friends. In Aley, the city where his family now settled, \n', 'he didn’t know anyone his age.\n', 'There was no school for Mohamad in Aley because government regulations \n', 'did not permit Syrian children to attend Lebanese schools. So, without school or \n', 'friends, Mohamad’s social life disappeared. As any young person would, Moha-\n', 'mad struggled and felt very alone.\n', 'Climate change had forced thousands of Syrians to leave their homes and \n', 'become refugees in Lebanon. Since farmers in Syria use only the rain—not ir-\n', 'rigation—to water their crops, they are especially vulnerable to climate change. \n', 'And since droughts are increasing—from once every 55 years, to once every seven \n', 'years—it’s hard for them to survive. Most of the farmers and unskilled laborers \n', 'who fled Syria to go to Lebanon ended up in the Beqaa Valley. And even if the \n', ' 200\n', 'conflict in Syria ends, many can’t go back there, since climate change has ravaged \n', 'their lands.\n', 'While Mohamad was home, without school, he discovered photography.\n', 'His father had introduced him to a well-known photographer, Ramzi Haid-\n', 'ar, who mentored Mohamad like his own son. It was the first time Mohamad had \n', 'ever touched a camera. He loved photography because it helped him to see and \n', 'appreciate the details of his new environment, as well as the wide range of human \n', 'emotions in a new light. Over the years, Mohamad’s photography has evolved: \n', 'he’s now produced three documentaries as well.\n', 'One day, he went with his mother and uncle to volunteer at a nearby refugee \n', 'camp. They brought food, clothing and materials to build tents. Mohamad was \n', 'too young to help the volunteers distribute everything, so he played with the chil-\n', 'dren who were living in the camp. After visiting several times, Mohamad made \n', 'new friends with children there. He soon realized that his volunteer work was a \n', 'two-way street. While he was helping them, doing something positive also made \n', 'him feel happy again: he liked being able to do something useful and productive. \n', 'He encouraged the children to take photos, and showed them how to do it so they \n', 'could share their stories. “These kids are too shy to talk, but they can take photos,” \n', 'Mohamad says. “They can create images of home, pictures of happiness.”\n', 'Mohamad started thinking about how he could do something more mean-\n', 'ingful, something that would help the children in the camp in a more significant \n', 'way. So, he decided to start his own school. At first, the “school” was very basic. \n', 'There were not many resources to work with. The school consisted of tents that \n', 'volunteers put up with their own hands. To begin, his family pooled their knowl-\n', 'edge to teach classes at the school. His mother taught math; his uncle taught \n', 'Arabic. And even though he was only 12, Mohamad taught the English classes.\n', 'On the very first day, Mohamad was thrilled to see that 100 children showed \n', 'up! To make room for everyone they had to hold different classes throughout the \n', 'day. They taught classes from 8:00 in the morning until 8:00 at night, so everyone \n', 'who wanted to could have a chance to learn.\n', 'With the school project, Mohamad finally felt like he had a new home. And \n', 'he had discovered his own form of activism as well.\n', 'From a young age, activism and revolution been part of his family’s life. His \n', 'mother was an active political organizer, and both of his parents had protested in \n', 'the Syrian revolution. Their living room was a hub of activity: there were always \n', 'activists coming and going from their home. Mohamad didn’t fully understand \n', 'what was happening at the time, but he understood that this was important work. \n', '201\n', '“From watching my parents, I started envisioning what it means to be an activist; \n', 'how you socialize with other people, how you build social networks,” he says.\n', 'He also came to understand that it was dangerous work: his mother was \n', 'arrested twice for her organizing activities. After her second arrest, she was told \n', 'she had a week to leave the country, or she would be arrested and killed. That’s \n', 'when Mohamad fled Syria with his family.\n', 'But for Mohamad, revolution is not just about protesting what is wrong. \n', '“Revolution is also about building a community,” he says. And it is about fighting \n', 'for positive ideas and values.\n', 'So, to expand the school they had started, Mohamad reached out to family \n', 'friends from Syria who now lived in Germany and asked them for help. Soon \n', 'schools all around Germany were sending school supplies and monetary dona-\n', 'tions. He named this initiative Kids for Kids. After a while, this new partnership \n', 'started to get media attention, and with the additional exposure came more re-\n', 'sources.\n', 'Unfortunately, the school didn’t last long. After only six months the Leba-\n', 'nese government destroyed the school and the four surrounding refugee camps. \n', 'This was a devastating loss for Mohamad: he felt like he had lost the underpinning \n', 'of his new life. To him it felt like a second displacement.\n', 'However, undeterred by this blow, Mohamad and his family found a creative \n', 'way to reopen the school. They rented a big house and turned it into a school. \n', 'The Lebanese owner was very sympathetic, and offered them legal protection so \n', 'they were safe to reopen.\n', 'Today Mohamad’s activism has expanded to an international stage. In \n', '2017, he and his mother and uncle moved to Sweden, where he started an NGO \n', '(non-governmental organization) called Gharsah Sweden, to support the refugee \n', 'school in Lebanon. And he is continuing to work tirelessly to preserve the educa-\n', 'tional values most important to him.\n', 'After winning the International Children’s Peace Prize, he now has more \n', 'money and resources to help the school. But Mohamad stresses the fact that \n', 'money isn’t all that is needed. “Activism can’t be focused only on raising money,” \n', 'he says. “It has to be a fight to end systemic issues. Even global issues are best \n', 'addressed when smaller communities are empowered. With enough support and \n', 'resources, local people and organizations can create the solutions that will work in \n', 'their own communities and situations.”\n', 'By building the school in a refugee camp, Mohamad and his family chal-\n', ' 202\n', 'lenged the system that creates refugees. “No one can expect refugees to start build-\n', 'ing schools out of nowhere and then just start teaching,” he says.\n', 'When Mohamad meets other young people on the frontlines of activism, \n', 'he feels encouraged and energized by their work. He also likes knowing he’s \n', 'not alone. “I realized you can be an activist, and also be normal,” he says.

Born in Atlanta, Georgia to immigrant parents from China, he had a hard \n', 'time finding people who shared his interest in entrepreneurship. At times, growing \n', 'up in the American South was quite difficult for him. Some days his mental health \n', 'suffered, and most days he felt very alone.\n', 'One day, after meeting an entrepreneurial high schooler, he realized there \n', 'must be others who felt the same sort of isolation that he did. So he decided to use \n', 'his experience, as well as his entrepreneurial and technical skills, to create com-\n', 'munities intent on bringing all kinds of people together. “In high school I tried \n', 'social entrepreneurship,” he says. “I designed several apps, which won me a few \n', 'pitch competitions, but they didn’t end up going anywhere. I loved the concept \n', 'of connecting changemakers to each other, but I wasn’t even sure yet what issues \n', 'I cared about myself.”\n', 'While researching an essay he was writing on the Paris climate agreement, \n', 'Jett reached out to 350 Pensacola, a local climate action network, for some exper-\n', 'tise, and they invited him to come to a meeting. This network was an amazing \n', 'source of information for Jett, and it set him on a path working toward climate \n', 'justice. But he noticed that very few youth environmentalists belonged to the net-\n', 'work. “So naturally, I began looking for a network of young people who were also \n', 'getting involved.”\n', 'Jett used Instagram to send direct messages to climate activists about getting \n', 'involved with youth movements. Eventually, Iris Zhan, a Chinese-American activ-\n', 'ist from Maryland, replied to him with a show of support. “This showed me that \n', 'there were people like me out there willing to help, and it really inspired me to get \n', 'involved in this movement in a bigger way.”\n', 'At 17, Jett took up the mantle as director of the 350 Pensacola Youth Climate \n', ' 204\n', 'Coalition. Shortly thereafter, on September 20, 2019, using his social media savvy \n', 'he organized a climate strike, and he got more than 150 people to attend. His \n', 'digital organizing experience brought him to Fridays For Future Digital (FFFD), \n', 'and he began collaborating with them on a much larger scale.\n', 'At FFFD, Jett found a niche, creating and developing digital protests. \n', 'Through various social media platforms, youth activists were urged to send photos \n', 'and messages, and to create digital collages showing the extensive support network \n', 'of youth around the world. “Activism is similar to entrepreneurship, only the end \n', 'goal is impact, not money,” Jett says. And considering the near-global lockdowns \n', 'from COVID-19, his impact has been all the more extraordinary. When the quar-\n', 'antine started in March 2020, people couldn’t physically protest. “But you can still \n', 'keep these important environmental issues on the top of your mind and that sense \n', 'of community strong, with digital activism.”\n', 'Jett’s efforts have helped FFFD empower thousands of activists, many of \n', 'whom are new to the movement. He hopes that getting more youth involved in \n', 'these campaigns can further help those in isolation feel some sense of community. \n', '“I ended up creating some of the strongest relationships of my life during a time \n', 'of isolation; which goes to show us the beauty that the technology can have if it’s \n', 'used in a positive way,” he says.\n', 'Jett often leverages the FFFD platform to assist environmental groups that \n', 'have less reach and visibility, and that normally wouldn’t have access to the re-\n', 'sources or networks to help them get meaningful exposure and community sup-\n', 'port. One story that was particularly important to Jett came to light via the work \n', 'of a partner group called Defend Defenders. Defend Defenders stands up for the \n', 'human rights of environmental defenders and Indigenous people in the East and \n', 'Horn of Africa subregions. Through this group, Jett learned about Friends of \n', 'Zoka, and he decided to get FFFD virtually involved with them.\n', 'Friends of Zoka is a group of northern Ugandans who are trying to stop ille-\n', 'gal logging in the rainforests, which has destroyed roughly 60 percent of the stand-\n', 'ing rainforest of the country in the last 20 years. “I reached out to the Whatsapp \n', 'number on their website and was able to speak with William Amanzuru, who was \n', 'cataloguing evidence of the devastation,” Jett says. At the time, William was hid-\n', 'ing from the local commissioner in the Moyo District. The Whatsapp technology \n', 'not only allowed Jett to communicate with him, but helped them work together \n', 'to coordinate a digital campaign to put pressure on the Ugandan government \n', 'through tweets and emails sent from around the world. “It just goes to show you \n', 'that even a social messaging app can impact change,” Jett says. “This wasn’t some-\n', '205\n', 'thing that was possible for wildlife defenders like William 20 years ago, when the \n', 'illegal foresting began.”\n', 'Jett has also played an integral role in connecting FFFD with the Re- Earth \n', 'Initiative, and combining their expertise as leading digital activist networks to in-\n', 'fluence legislation for vulnerable groups worldwide. The focus of their most recent \n', 'joint effort is to raise awareness and support from Caribbean and Latin American \n', 'governments for the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Par-\n', 'ticipation, and Justice in Environmental Matters. This is a groundbreaking piece \n', 'of legislation for persecuted Indigenous peoples, which is better known as the \n', '#EscazúAgreement because it was first adopted in Escazú, Costa Rica.\n', 'The #EscazúAgreement is the first binding treaty in Latin America and \n', 'the Caribbean to deal with environmental democracy and environmental human \n', 'rights. In many places in these regions, the Indigenous populations are horribly \n', 'abused by powerful corporations and the rogue government officials that allow \n', 'the corporations free reign, simply for standing up for and protecting their land. \n', 'Currently, there is little legal recourse for a defender of the environment who \n', 'is being persecuted, strong-armed, bribed, physically harmed and intimidated, \n', 'or even murdered by outside interests. Ratifying this agreement would provide \n', 'the Indigenous populations who are being exploited proper access to data about \n', 'ongoing projects, and the chance to participate in the planning and conversations \n', 'around what projects will be allowed. Perhaps most importantly, it provides legal \n', 'protections for those who are persecuted while defending the natural habitats they \n', 'call home. “I’m honored to spend my time defending the most vulnerable people \n', 'in the most vulnerable places,” Jett says. “This sort of community building is \n', 'something I will always be involved in.”\n', 'Jett wants young people to understand that whatever the scope of the cause \n', 'they are interested in, or whatever your personality is, you can get involved in a \n', 'way that suits you as an individual. Many types of people coming together is what \n', 'makes the climate movement so impactful. “For example, I like to design systems \n', 'behind the scenes,” Jett says. “I like to engage in digital community building. I \n', 'play many roles for FFFD that aren’t obvious or glamorous, but they make just as \n', 'significant an impact on the cause as the outward-facing figures of the movement. \n', 'I like to say to other activists who are reserved, like me, you can’t make a movie \n', 'without the cameraman, can you?”\n', 'With up and coming leaders like Jett, who are so effective at digitally orga-\n', 'nizing youth communities, the climate justice movement has significantly expand-\n', 'ed its reach to a network of tech-savvy, motivated activists across the virtual world. \n', ' 206\n', 'This virtual approach by FFFD and youth leaders like Jett shows that no matter \n', 'what logistical problems may arise from something like a pandemic, innovative \n', 'activists will always have opportunities to use their intelligence and their creativity \n', 'to keep the momentum of their work rolling forward.\n', 'While incorporating the guidance of environmental activists before him, Jett \n', 'has set an example of digital resilience in the face of myriad obstacles, through \n', 'his efforts at organizing online protests and shining a light on stories that will no \n', 'longer go untold.

However climate change is ravaging this \n', 'nation. Nigeria is not alone: many African nations are desperately facing water \n', 'scarity. Without water, crops can’t grow, which leads to millions of people at risk \n', 'of malnutrition. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that \n', 'more than 815 million people are malnourished around the world.

Through education, she hopes the \n', 'movement will spread. “When people know how to use alternative energy, they \n', 'can replicate these actions, and other people will learn how to use them,” she \n', 'explains. “With that, changing habits becomes more rapid, and naturally people \n', 'will switch from fossil fuels without being forced.”\n', 'For International Women’s Day in 2021, Adenike believes that environmen-\n', 'tal issues should be the core theme, so that women’s issues can be brought to the \n', 'forefront of the climate justice movement. As she has grown into her role as an \n', 'international leader in the climate movement, she’s concerned that there is too \n', 'little focus on communities in the Global South. In 2019, when she attended COP \n', '25 in Madrid, she expected that the regeneration of Lake Chad, and its innovative \n', 'climate finance programs, which are helping communities adapt to and reduce \n', 'the effects of climate change, would be spotlighted. But to her dismay, climate \n', 'change in the Lake Chad region was hardly even mentioned. “If international \n', 'representatives don’t recognize the current dangers of climate change in African \n', 'countries, there will be global repercussions,” she says. For example, the people \n', 'who are being displaced by climate change are increasingly migrating to countries \n', 'in the Global North. Many have already been forced to leave their homes and live \n', 'in refugee camps. “If Africa loses the race of climate action, it’s going to affect all \n', 'of our countries,” Adenike says, and she emphasizes, “We really need to support \n', 'Africa now.”\n', 'In Nigeria, Adenike is fighting to re-subsidize renewable energy, and find \n', '209\n', 'sources of energy that have low carbon emissions. “Every nation everywhere \n', 'needs to prioritize renewable energy,” she says. She also wants to see more unified \n', 'government action, so that climate change is treated as the crisis that it is. She was \n', 'disappointed that representatives at COP 25 failed to ratify Article 6 of the Paris \n', 'Agreement, which promotes international cooperation among nations in order to \n', 'reach their carbon emission targets. “Article 6 is essential if we are to reduce the \n', 'effects of climate change,” she says. “There must be more unified action in order \n', 'for the Paris Agreement to succeed.”\n', 'Currently Adenike’s climate activism focuses on two major fronts. First, she \n', 'is trying to engage the world’s youth, especially in African countries, and get them \n', 'to really care about climate change. “Many youth have yet to pay attention to \n', 'these issues that will define our future,” she says.

She formed a committee with other young lead-\n', 'ers to coordinate and strengthen their efforts. This was the beginning of her “In-\n', 'visible to Visible” movement, a campaign founded to address the social exclusion \n', 'of those who are marginalized. She also wrote a book about her experiences, and \n', 'what she had learned from her research into social issues, entitled Social Invisibility \n', 'Is Not a Fiction It Exists.\n', 'Michelle had often heard her elders talk about changing weather patterns \n', 'in Sri Lanka. She learned that farmers and those with low incomes—exactly the \n', '“invisible” people she had been fighting for—were increasingly being affected by \n', 'climate change.\n', 'Farmers struggle with frequent and intense floods and droughts, leading to \n', 'decreased crop yield.

Each day, the youth who were there would tell their \n', 'friends about what they were doing; and the next day even more people would \n', 'show up.\n', '“The best thing was that all these young people joined together and started \n', 'this project,” Michelle says. “And to our surprise a lot of the people who were at \n', 'the beaches actually joined us—so I think somehow they must have gotten the \n', 'message.”\n', 'Michelle has continued to use her steadily growing social media channels, \n', 'and the airtime she gets on TV, to talk about the issues that are close to her heart. \n', 'She also organizes awareness campaigns in schools and universities.\n', 'And her popularity continues to grow. In 2018, she received the Asian In-\n', 'spiration Award; in 2019 she won the National Youth Icon Award; and in 2020 \n', 'she was nominated as both the Best Upcoming Actress and Most Popular Actress \n', 'of the Year.

And wondering, how do we do something about it?”\n', 'He didn’t know what to do. But he’d read authors like Hermann Hesse, Jack \n', 'Kerouac, and Joseph Campbell, whose work awoke in him the call to adventure. \n', '“I felt like that archetypal character who had the same big questions, longing for \n', 'answers. So I dropped out of high school, left my family and friends, and went to \n', 'the West Coast. It was a time of deep existential crisis. I was very depressed. I felt \n', 'no hope or meaning. I felt like I was born to watch the world fall apart.”\n', 'At 21, Joshua went to visit a friend on the Big Island in Hawai’i. He planned \n', 'to stay two weeks but it would be three full years before he boarded a flight back \n', 'home to D.C.\n', '215\n', '“In Hawai’i, I found myself having a back-to-nature experience. I was taken \n', 'in by a local farmer. I lived on his farm, worked the land, and learned how to grow \n', 'things. Mainly, I got out of my head. I had all these negative thought patterns my \n', 'whole life that I couldn’t escape. Working on the land helped me to drop out of my \n', 'head and into my body.

It was a deep and embodied ecological awakening. \n', 'So much of what my soul was longing for, I found in Hawai’i.”\n', 'With this grounding in nature, Joshua began to explore other spiritual paths \n', 'and traditions. He started to meditate and do yoga, and spent long stretches of \n', 'time in solitude and in nature. Slowly, through his own organic process of spiritual \n', 'awakening, he started to experience simple yet profound moments of happiness \n', 'and inner peace. “I didn’t know those things were possible, coming from a culture \n', 'of so much darkness. It was a whole different side of life. It was also a time when \n', 'I was reading lots of books and beginning to understand the larger historical \n', 'process at play. It helped me realize that our world is not just falling apart, but that \n', 'we’re at a turning point. An old paradigm is dying, and a new world is being born.”\n', 'One day Joshua was walking and he had his epiphany. “I realized the young \n', 'people of our generation have a purpose like no generation before. To be a bridge \n', 'from the old to the new. On one hand, it’s one of the hardest times for young \n', 'people to be alive. But we can also look at these times in a different light.

Young people \n', 'today have the opportunity to lead social movements and make sweeping changes \n', 'on our planet like we’ve never seen before. In that moment, I really believed, in \n', 'the depth of my soul, that we are going to make it.

He had a vision, but he knew he \n', 'needed the training and education in order to fulfill it. But what he wanted to \n', 'learn was hard to find, so he created his own major – Global Youth and Social \n', 'Change. He began working, learning, volunteering, and mentoring with all types \n', 'of nonprofits, youth programs, and social justice organizations.\n', 'As he engaged in social change movements, he approached it in a holistic \n', 'way. “We don’t need environmental, political, or economic change. We needed a \n', 'systems change. A complete cultural shift in our values and structure,” he says.\n', 'In trying to answer the question of how to bring about this larger, systemic \n', ' 216\n', 'change came Joshua’s vision for Generation Waking Up. Its mission: to ignite a \n', 'generation of young people to bring forth a “thriving, just, and sustainable world.” \n', 'Its flagship workshop is called “The WakeUp Experience,” a 2-3 hour multime-\n', 'dia experience that explores four specific questions: Who are we? Where are we? \n', 'What has to change? and What do we do now?\n', '“It’s a framework and curriculum for these times,” Joshua explains. “We are \n', 'training spiritual activists and systemic change makers. There’s a lot of personal \n', 'and interpersonal leadership training involved, which is so often lacking in work-\n', 'shops and training programs. It really helps, to connect the dots between the inner \n', 'work and the outer work. This connection is essential for any individual and group \n', 'to be effective.”\n', 'Addressing these complicated social issues can be daunting. This holistic \n', 'worldview is important to Joshua because it’s precisely this understanding that \n', 'he himself lacked as a youth. “There’s this notion around urgency that I think is \n', 'incomplete. Yes, we need to be out there taking action against these big problems. \n', 'Mobilizing and spreading awareness. Because it’s true, our times are urgent times. \n', 'But sometimes we also need to take a step back. Retreat. Take some time alone \n', 'in nature. Meditate. And listen. Just listen. To the wisdom that comes from that \n', 'deeper place when we’re alone in nature. Or to a spiritual advisor or mentor. We \n', 'need to tap into that deeper well of meaning and inspiration that is necessary \n', 'in order to sustain our social change work.

I will do \n', 'what I can.” And it continued fighting the fire.\n', 'Everyone in Lesein’s country of Kenya respected the great Wangari Maathai, \n', 'who shared this story with people to inspire them to join her Green Belt Move-\n', 'ment, and plant trees to restore their country’s degraded watersheds and save their \n', 'livelihoods. In 2004, the year Lesein was born, she received the Nobel Peace Prize \n', 'for her contributions to sustainable development, democracy, and peace. She is \n', 'one of Lesein’s biggest heroes.\n', 'One day, when he was 14 years old Lesein was on his way to school, sitting \n', 'in his mom’s car, when he realized something awful. He was reading about de-\n', 'forestation and air pollution in Kenya. Lesein loves going on hikes, cycling, and \n', 'camping out in the nature. But he realized that unless something was done about \n', 'these issues, soon all of this would no longer be possible.\n', '“I decided to do further research,” he says. He learned that Kenya’s forests \n', 'have suffered a lot in past decades. In 1963, when the country became indepen-\n', 'dent, 12 percent of Kenya was covered in forests. By 2015, the forest cover was \n', 'down to only 7.6 percent. “I calculated that in Kenya, we were losing ten football \n', 'pitches [of forest] every hour.”\n', 'Ten football pitches—Lesein knows very well how much that is. Because \n', 'above all, he is a passionate football player. He plays for Ligi Ndogo, a football \n', 'club in his hometown of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. And it was the combina-\n', 'tion of his passion for sports and his environmental awareness that gave him an \n', 'ingenious idea: he decided that for every goal he would score, he would plant one \n', 'tree. He would fight deforestation one tree, and one goal, at a time.\n', '“No matter how big the problem is, I just needed to make a difference,” he \n', 'says. And so, in honor of his hero Wangari Maathai, who died in 2011, Lesein \n', 'founded the organization, Trees4Goals.\n', 'Every week Lesein would go to football practice and train with his team-\n', 'mates. When he came home, he would note down how many goals he had scored \n', 'in a little book. The next week, he would buy a little tree from a roadside store; \n', 'then he would head out and plant it in a school, park, or forest.\n', '“The problem is that people are not replanting,” he explains. And the con-\n', 'sequences of this are deforestation and air pollution. “Trees take in polluted air,” \n', 'he says. “Planting trees is really important to reverse climate change.” That is why \n', 'Lesein set himself a clear goal: he wants forests to grow back to cover more than10 \n', 'percent of Kenya.\n', ' 222\n', 'For Lesein, fighting against climate change means fighting for the survival of \n', 'his community. Last year, mudslides devastated Northwestern Kenya after a rainy \n', 'season that was much heavier than usual. “There have also been droughts, and \n', 'because of that, we have less food,” he says. “So there are farmers who are in real \n', 'trouble, who aren’t able to grow their crops.”\n', 'After a while, Lesein realized that he needed to do even more. “I decided to \n', 'increase my commitment. So for every goal I score, I decided to plant ten trees.” \n', 'Soon, the people around him took note of his efforts. His teammates joined in \n', 'planting the trees. Then his school’s rugby team wanted to participate. And when \n', 'one of his friends asked if he could do the same thing, only for basketball, “I told \n', 'him of course he can!” Lesein says. So now, there is also a Hoops4Trees group, \n', 'joining with Trees4Goals in planting trees.\n', 'When a high school in South Africa invited Lesein to join forces, he began \n', 'extending his work to other African countries. “As we expand, I make sure people \n', 'learn from the experience,” he says. “And that they take home with them an ap-\n', 'preciation for why we’re they’re doing this.”\n', 'For Lesein, making sure that people understand what is at stake is an im-\n', 'portant aspect of his activism. “Many people in my generation don’t know about \n', 'what’s happening to our planet,” he says. “No one is teaching them; we’re not \n', 'taught this in school.” Too often, he says, people feel that you need to be an activ-\n', 'ist or a scientist to understand what is driving climate change. With Trees4Goals, \n', 'Lesein gets people involved and educates them at the same time. “For them to \n', 'know what’s behind deforestation and pollution, and how we can reduce it by \n', 'planting trees, that really keeps them interested,” he says.\n', 'Lesein is keen on getting as many people as possible to talk about the topic, \n', 'and take action. Last year, together with his football club, he planted 600 trees \n', 'in the Karura Forest, a park in Nairobi. In Ngong Forest he planted another 350 \n', 'trees, together with his schoolmates. “We would finish one tree and move on to the \n', 'next,” he says. “When we really got the hang of it, it was fun.”\n', 'Lesein feels that football, which is the most popular sport in the world, is a \n', 'great way to educate people. “There are so many famous footballers who have \n', 'a powerful influence on people,” he said. “With their large stadium audiences, \n', 'they can influence thousands of others to go out and learn more about the prob-\n', 'lems, and create a very, very big awareness.” He has an ambitious goal to take his \n', 'Trees4Goals campaign to the next level: he wants to get FIFA, the International \n', 'Federation of Association Football, on board. “If this happens, there’ll really be a \n', 'big difference on the topic of climate change,” he says. “There’ll be a large num-\n', '223\n', 'ber of people that will then know about environmental conservation. It would be \n', 'amazing!”\n', 'Over the last few years, Lesein has become an emblem of environmental \n', 'activism in Kenya. He uses his social media channels on Instagram and Facebook \n', 'to advertise his tree-planting projects. And last year he was invited to participate in \n', 'the United Nations Climate Summit. “That was an amazing experience,” he says. \n', 'It was the first time he had travelled outside of Kenya. He especially liked getting \n', 'to know activists from all around the world at the conference. And he participated \n', 'in a climate strike, where he heard Greta Thunberg address the crowd. Because \n', 'he was wearing his Trees4Goals T-shirt, people came up to him and asked him \n', 'about it.\n', '“I was happy to be able to share my story, and tell why I was doing it with \n', 'great confidence,” he says.\n', 'When Lesein returned from his journey, he had a very special meeting on his \n', 'schedule. President Uhuru Kenyatta had invited him to plant a tree at the State \n', 'House, the official residence of the president of Kenya. “I was so excited,” he says. \n', '“I’m becoming friends with the president!”\n', 'But, as the story of Lesein shows, you don’t need to be the friend of a presi-\n', 'dent to make a change. “I’ve learned that no action is too small,” he says. “Every-\n', 'thing counts, no matter how small it is.”\n', 'Lesein says it is his generation that will have to pay for the poor choices \n', 'of previous ones. He believes that young people need to be at the frontline of \n', 'the discussions about climate change, in order to prevent previous mistakes from \n', 'being repeated. “We have our voices, we have the numbers, we literally control \n', 'social media,” he says.\n', 'When times get tough, Lesein thinks back to his childhood. He remembers \n', 'the story of the hummingbird, and the work of Wangari Maathai. “We must take \n', 'any action that is possible, because every action counts,” he says. “And we should \n', 'just start.

In front of it there was a garbage dump that \n', 'had been used by the police to store confiscated vehicles that were never reclaimed \n', 'by their owners. Slowly, the locals had added their trash, creating a landfill right in \n', 'the middle of Aadya’s neighborhood. The cars were stacked on top of each other, \n', 'some decades old, and the stench of the trash between the car wrecks would drift \n', 'through the streets in the hot summer months.\n', '“For a long time, my friends and I tried to figure out why no one was doing \n', 'anything about it,” says Aadya. “So in the end I went to the police commissioner \n', 'and the inspector and I said okay, I can make a garden in this garbage dump if it’s \n', 'not being used productively.”\n', 'It took another month of convincing, but ultimately the police agreed. \n', 'Aadya got some friends and local residents together, and for a month they met \n', 'every weekend, cleaned out the trash, removed the contaminated soil, replaced \n', 'it, and moved the old cars. They even cut up some of the cars, turning them into \n', 'pots for some of the plants. Then they spent another weekend planting the garden \n', '225\n', 'in the old garbage dump. “It turned into a community project,” says Aadya. “This \n', 'garbage dump had been an issue in our community for a while.”\n', 'For Aadya, this urban gardening project was the spark that lit a fire. She saw \n', 'the power of one community garden, so she wanted to create even more. Then, \n', 'at a workshop on gardens she was inspired to become the environmental activist \n', 'she is today. “Their philosophy was to plant a lot of native trees to create an urban \n', 'forest,” Aadya explains.\n', 'Aadya had learned about native and nonnative plants in biology class. How-\n', 'ever, she had never realized how important native plant species were to the plan-\n', 'et’s ecosystems, even in a big city like Mumbai. “What I learned in the workshop, \n', 'I thought that’s actually really smart,” she says. “You plant things that are native \n', 'because they provide more ecological stability.”\n', 'Aadya embarked on a discovery process that led to the research of Dr. Doug \n', 'Tallamy, a professor in the Department of Entomology and Wildlife Ecology at \n', 'the University of Delaware. From him she learned how important native plants \n', 'were for supporting local insects, which in turn were an important source of food \n', 'for local bird species.\n', 'This reminded her of the stories her grandfather had told her about the \n', 'Mumbai of his childhood. He had described trips with his family, where they \n', 'would see leopards, and colorful birds in the trees. It was a very different Mumbai \n', 'from the one that Aadya knows, polluted and smelly; the only birds she ever saw \n', 'were pigeons and crows.\n', 'Suddenly Aadya understood why there were no more colorful birds in the \n', 'trees of Mumbai: they were the wrong trees! The problem in India goes back to \n', 'colonial times, Aadya explains. The British brought with them many types of trees \n', 'that weren’t native to the region, and they were slowly adopted by local people. \n', 'But because these trees weren’t from India, the local insect and bird populations \n', 'couldn’t feed off of them or adapt quickly enough.\n', '“In India, but especially in Mumbai, you see a lot of these colonial, nonna-\n', 'tive invasive plants,” Aadya says. “For example, rain trees. People say they’ve been \n', 'here for so long, they must be a vital part of our ecosystem.”\n', 'But actually, rain trees are from Costa Rica, and so is the wildlife they sup-\n', 'port. Those species that can live on the rain tree simply don’t exist in Mumbai.\n', '“If you plant native plants, then the insects come back, the butterflies come \n', 'back, you have caterpillars, and with them the birds come back,” Aadya explains. \n', 'When she read the work of Dr. Tallamy it was like a switch was turned inside her \n', ' 226\n', 'head.\n', '“I realized that maybe planting gardens was not the right thing to do,” she \n', 'says. “But if I could teach people what we should be planting and why, that would \n', 'be a much more valuable lesson.”\n', 'So Aadya launched her new plan, and sprang into action. In a local nature \n', 'park, she started offering workshops for children ages five to twelve. It was late \n', '2019, and the beginning of her organization, The Right Green.\n', 'She tested out her workshop ideas on her little brother, and her aim was \n', 'simple: teach children about the importance of native plants for local ecosystems, \n', 'and make sure they have fun at the same time.\n', '“The first part of the workshop gets them into nature, since we have a lack \n', 'of open spaces here,” she says. “And the second thing is that I try to teach them \n', 'how native plants support insects and biodiversity, and how nonnative plants don’t \n', 'support it.”\n', 'Aadya makes sure that her students have fun: she takes them around the park \n', 'and lets them find trees based on different clues. When they find the trees, she asks, \n', '“What kind of tree is this? Did you notice more insects on this tree versus another? \n', 'What differences do you see?”\n', '“I get them thinking about why it is that this mango tree has so many insects, \n', 'butterflies, and birds living in it, while something like a rain tree has maybe one \n', 'bird resting on it, but not even nesting within it.”\n', 'Aadya is happy that these workshops are having a positive impact: children \n', 'are sharing their new awareness with their families while they plant their gardens \n', 'at home. And adults are reaching out to her for advice about what plants they \n', 'should put in their gardens.\n', 'This need for advice gave Aadya her next idea. She created a database of \n', 'native plants and ranked them by the amount of biodiversity they supported. Dr. \n', 'Tallamy had accumulated this kind of data for the United States, so Aadya got \n', 'in touch with him to learn more about his methods. What she learned from him \n', 'she used to produce a dataset on native plants in India. “What I want to create is \n', 'a resource that a lot of people can use so that when they plant their gardens, they \n', 'will seed well,” she says.\n', 'Aadya’s innovation has brought praise and support. She was awarded fund-\n', 'ing by The Pollination Project, an international organization that funds projects \n', 'aimed at social change. With the money she received, Aadya printed booklets to \n', 'give people in her workshops. She also produced a short animated video for social \n', '227\n', 'media that explains the importance of planting not just any trees, but the right \n', 'ones—the “right green.”\n', 'With climate change causing ever more extreme weather in India, the need \n', 'for planting native trees only becomes more urgent, Aadya says. Native trees are \n', 'more resilient and can adapt more easily to changing conditions than nonnative \n', 'trees. And having a healthy population of plants is indispensable for the sustain-\n', 'ability of ecosystems anywhere.\n', '“The whole point about planting native is to reduce the damage that climate \n', 'change has done,” says Aadya. “There is this relationship between the plants, the \n', 'insects, and the birds, and then the rest of the food chain, to help repair some of \n', 'the damage.”\n', 'With her workshop and her database, Aadya is educating both future gener-\n', 'ations and those making seemingly small decisions today, like what plants to put in \n', 'their garden, that can have a big impact. “If we don’t make a conscious effort to \n', 'change, and to make the world someplace that we want to live in, then we’re really \n', 'not doing our duty as current and future leaders,” she says.\n', '“It’s like my dad and my grandfather always told me, if you want something \n', 'to happen, you have to do it yourself.

So, after a long lecture on the value of the equipment, \n', 'Cruz got to try his hand at underwater photography for the first time, using his \n', 'father’s old camera. His father gave him a quick explanation of what the different \n', 'dials on the camera would do, but from there on out it was all about experiment-\n', 'ing with different perspectives, and trying to capture various species underwater. \n', '“It wasn’t something I really thought of taking to a high level,” he says. “It was \n', '229\n', 'just for fun.”\n', 'Then one day, on a diving trip in the Lembeh Strait off North Sulawesi, \n', 'Indonesia, camera in hand, he had an unexpected encounter with a Bigfin Reef \n', 'Squid. Cruz raised his camera and pressed the shutter. In the photo, the animal \n', 'hovers in the pitch black, glowing in different shades of blue, green, brown, and \n', 'red, its tentacles stretched out in front of it.

He was \n', 'thrilled to meet Dr. Sylvia Earle, a marine biologist he greatly admires, who spoke \n', 'there, and said, “I wish you would use all means at your disposal—films, expedi-\n', 'tions, the web, new submarines—to create a campaign to ignite public support for \n', 'a global network of marine protected areas—‘hope spots’ large enough to save \n', 'and restore the blue heart of the planet.” And as he began his presentation, Cruz \n', 'said, “We blink 15 to 20 times a minute. Why? We blink because our eyes haven’t \n', 'yet fully adapted to seeing outside of water.”\n', '“Life on our planet is shaped by the oceans,” Cruz says. Ocean currents \n', 'regulate the earth’s temperature. Plankton and other ocean plant species produce \n', 'more than 60 percent of all of the oxygen found in our atmosphere. But human \n', 'activity is destroying biodiversity and the intricate ecosystems that support life un-\n', 'derwater. “It’s a great natural resource,” Cruz says. “But it’s become expendable, \n', 'and we’ve been pushing it to the brink.”\n', 'Growing up in Indonesia, Cruz was able to witness the importance of \n', 'marine life and coral reefs for local communities. “Coral reefs are fish factories,” \n', 'Cruz said, on the stage at Davos. “They produce a large amount of fish mass that \n', 'spills into the surrounding ecosystems, linking it with the food chain that extends \n', 'into the open ocean.”\n', 'Oceans provide a livelihood to people where crops simply can’t grow, and \n', 'other natural resources aren’t available. Ecosystems like coral reefs support coastal \n', 'populations as well as all the other life in the ocean. But climate change is causing \n', 'them to bleach and die off more than in the past. “Most instances of bleaching \n', 'occur during El Nino warming events,” Cruz says. “And those are now more in-\n', 'tense, and more common, with climate change.” During diving trips in Indonesia \n', ' 230\n', 'and the Maldives, as well as in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, Cruz \n', 'has noticed that some coral reefs are more resilient to changing temperatures than \n', 'others. But he adds, “Most of them are suffering badly around the world.”\n', 'Cruz explains that the invention of trawl nets and large-scale fishing has \n', 'led to a new level of consumerism that is simply not sustainable. “For a long time, \n', 'there was an assumption that we could just fish as much as we wanted, without \n', 'decimating populations. But we can’t.”\n', 'The main problem, as Cruz argued on the stage at Davos, is that we have \n', 'become so disconnected from the oceans. We buy our food from the shelves of \n', 'supermarkets, without thinking twice about where it came from. This means that \n', 'most people are unaware of the negative effects their decisions as consumers have \n', 'on the environment–effects that include overfishing, pollution, and habitat de-\n', 'struction. “We’ve basically grown used to it as consumers of the ocean,” he says. \n', '“And it hasn’t really stopped, even though we know that it is having a very negative \n', 'impact.”\n', 'Another threat caused by climate change is ocean acidification. This hap-\n', 'pens when the oceans have to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere \n', 'than usual. That changes the chemical balance of sea water, and many organisms \n', 'can no longer grow properly. Oysters, mussels, and plankton can even be dissolved \n', 'if the water is too acidic.\n', '“If the foundations of our ocean food chains are not able to grow their shells, \n', 'the consequences will be disastrous,” Cruz says. “It’s a serious issue, with real \n', 'consequences that affect every single one of us, no matter how far from the ocean \n', 'we live.”\n', 'Cruz wants to change the way we look at the ocean. By sharing powerful \n', 'photographic images, he wants to give the creatures living underwater a face—\n', 'and help us to see that our current way of life is unsustainable.\n', 'As an underwater photographer, Cruz feels it is his responsibility to bridge \n', 'the gap between humans and the ocean. “I want to captivate people’s attention \n', 'about a world they may never have seen before,” he says. “And allow us to develop \n', 'a better appreciation for our dependence on the ocean.” He is particularly inter-\n', 'ested in macro photography, in which the objects photographed are very close \n', 'to the lens. “It’s like exploring a hidden world through much sharper eyes than \n', 'my own,” he says. Many people don’t really think of fish as animals. It’s hard to \n', 'imagine that they can feel pain, and even harder to have an affinity for them. But \n', 'fish—especially the tiny fish that Cruz likes to take pictures of—are the “rice of \n', 'the reef.” “Without them, the coral reef ecosystem would crumble and starve,” he \n', '231\n', 'says. “They are the staple base food; they keep the coral reef ecosystems going.”\n', 'On a recent dive in the Maldives, Cruz was overcome with a feeling of awe. \n', 'He was surrounded by marine wildlife.

Or even how to steer a canoe!” she says. “That’s when \n', 'it struck me that for the Indigenous people, the river is much more than a food \n', '233\n', 'source; it’s also their cultural heritage, transportation, and recreation.”\n', 'Having studied environmental science in college, she did know, however, \n', 'that the waters of that sacred river were being polluted by mercury. And two \n', 'weeks in the interior forced her to reckon with what might happen to Guyana’s \n', 'Indigenous population if the pollution of the river continues. “They have no other \n', 'means of survival,” she says.\n', 'As a child, Benita had always been drawn to the natural world. Growing up \n', 'in a city and attending school in the capital, Georgetown, she didn’t have many \n', 'opportunities to learn about environmental issues. But she did what she could. She \n', 'joined her school’s environment club, went on “green walks,” and participated in \n', 'a scouts program that allowed her to go on several trips to the country’s interior.\n', 'When she was first admitted to the University of Guyana, she had planned \n', 'to study to become a nutritionist. But then she decided to follow her heart and \n', 'study environmental science instead. She was shocked to learn what a devastating \n', 'impact the mining companies were having on Guyana’s environment. The two \n', 'smallest countries in South America—Guyana, and neighboring Suriname—\n', 'alone account for 10 to 15 percent of the entire nation’s freshwater resources. \n', 'However, the mining practices of the 40,000 artisanal gold miners who work \n', 'along the rivers in Guyana are threatening the water quality. And the recent dis-\n', 'covery of vast oil deposits in the country is making it easier for people to strike it \n', 'rich; but it also poses an existential threat to the environment.\n', 'Benita realized that for many people in her country, the problem is basic: \n', 'they simply don’t understand the importance of protecting the water. “I decided \n', 'that if I could help students, teachers, and youth groups develop an apprecia-\n', 'tion for the importance of protecting freshwater, it could filter down into their \n', 'homes and communities. The problem needs to be tackled by all age groups and \n', 'demographics,” she says. “Many adults aren’t aware of how their activities can \n', 'affect this precious resource. We need to help everyone, regardless of their level of \n', 'education or economic background, to understand that water is essential for life.”\n', 'After she graduated from the University of Guyana, Benita began to vol-\n', 'unteer with Policy Forum Guyana, where she learned about various educational \n', 'tools to help inspire young people to take action for the environment. And she \n', 'took an environmental workshop called Sandwatch, where she was connected \n', 'with and learned from global scientists and educators.\n', 'Sandwatch  is  an  interdisciplinary  educational  process  through  which \n', 'students, teachers, and local communities work together in the field to monitor \n', 'coastal environments; identify and evaluate the threats, problems, and conflicts \n', ' 234\n', 'facing them; and develop sustainable approaches for addressing them. With the \n', 'Sandwatch approach, involved groups not only learn to understand their envi-\n', 'ronment; they also develop critical thinking skills, and learn how to apply them to \n', 'conflict resolution. Sandwatch seeks to integrate the values inherent in sustainable \n', 'development into all aspects of learning, through a practical hands-on approach, \n', 'empowering citizens of all ages to become involved in positive environmental and \n', 'social change.\n', 'Benita’s exposure to Sandwatch impressed upon her the importance of \n', 'getting young people to start thinking about the environment from an early age \n', 'through hands-on activities, like going out into their communities to monitor wa-\n', 'ter quality, observing how climate change is affecting beaches, and learning what \n', 'must be done to offset the dire impacts of climate change and natural disasters. \n', 'She also wanted to make environmental activism fun for kids. Inspired by the \n', 'Sandwatch approach, which incorporates a range of disciplines, from biology to \n', 'woodwork, from geography to art, and from poetry to mathematics—and follow-\n', 'ing her lifelong passion for cartoons and games, she set out to develop a game \n', 'about preserving freshwater resources. The game she created, the River Guardian \n', 'Freshwater board game, is now in the process of being distributed to students \n', 'across the country.\n', 'Meanwhile, the environmental movement in Guyana has begun to steadi-\n', 'ly increase, and what was once a small trickle of activism has become a steady \n', 'stream. On September 29, 2019 Benita, with the help of volunteers, organized \n', 'a rally in solidarity with Greta Thunberg’s global Fridays for Future movement, \n', 'which brought more than 500 youth climate activists into the streets of George-\n', 'town. Many of them carried signs and banners proclaiming their fight as river \n', 'guardians. Others called for people to protect the ocean, which is steadily rising \n', 'and threatening the homes and communities of coastal residents.\n', 'Guyana’s government has taken notice of this growing, and increasingly \n', 'vocal, movement. The Green State Development Strategy is now a key part of \n', 'President David Granger’s development plan for the country; and the country’s \n', 'Ministry of Communities recently launched a #GreenGenerationGy hashtag as a \n', 'way to bring more youth into the movement.\n', '“At first, no one really wanted to support teaching climate change in the \n', 'schools,” Benita says. “But then, literally after seeing what was happening globally, \n', 'a lot of people became interested in being a part of this movement.” It was called \n', 'the River Guardian Project. The board game Benita invented has also turned \n', 'heads around the world. The government of the Netherlands even reached out \n', '235\n', 'to her to see how they could get involved in producing more educational games \n', 'for kids.\n', 'Benita realizes that it’s not just young people who need to become sensitized \n', 'to the importance of freshwater resources, but all of the people of Guyana. She \n', 'sees her job as letting both young people and adults know that everyone can play \n', 'a role in becoming a river guardian—and everyone is needed in the effort.\n', 'Now that she’s graduated from university, Benita is focusing all of her efforts \n', 'on activism: she spends a lot of time meeting with representatives of NGOs and \n', 'government officials.

The first is to help the people of interested coun-\n', 'tries meet their need for training men and women, and this always comes from \n', 'the host country. For example, Malawi had expressed a need for more English \n', 'teachers, so that’s why I was sent there.” The other two goals are about promoting \n', 'better understanding among Americans toward the rest of the world, and of other \n', 'people toward Americans.\n', 'Along with her fellow teachers, Jill lived in a row of houses made with bricks \n', 'that were formed from the dirt and clay underfoot. She taught English classes \n', 'in Malawi in their developing community day schools. These secondary schools \n', 'were built by, for, and in the community, with locally sourced material—and as-\n', 'tounding ingenuity. “Early on I was told that I could farm the land in front of \n', 'and behind my house, which I hadn’t thought about doing. I was there to teach \n', 'English, after all.”\n', 'Soon other teachers noticed her empty plot, and asked Jill if they could \n', 'use her untended land.

As an English teacher in the making, Jill taught \n', ' 238\n', 'the standard curriculum. But she always felt that she could inspire them in a \n', 'more profound way with a bit of creativity. “One thing I’d do is take their writing \n', 'assignments, mail them back to America for my mom to type up, then bind these \n', 'pages in spiral notebooks and send them back to Malawi, so I could show my kids \n', 'what their words looked like ‘published’ in a book. It really gave them a lot of \n', 'confidence.”\n', 'Jill also inspired her community outside of the classroom. She created com-\n', 'petitive clubs for games like Scrabble – which led to a natural exchange of cultures, \n', 'when her friends taught her the traditional Malawian game of Bawo. “I definitely \n', 'didn’t get any favors or special treatment learning to play Bawo,” she says with \n', 'a laugh. She even started a girls’ soccer team, hoping to further empower young \n', 'women in the community. “I was nominated as a coach, and we ended up orga-\n', 'nizing a girls soccer game with a neighboring village.” When one of the members \n', 'of the local parliament showed up at the game and seemed to be scowling, Jill \n', 'thought she might be upset because the girls were wearing pants instead of their \n', 'usual dresses.

The second is ahimsa, which focus-\n', 'es on creating a culture of love, compassion, and understanding. It’s about doing \n', 'as little harm or violence as possible. For Shilpa, this manifests powerfully not only \n', 'with people, but with “how I feel toward the trees, the birds, the small insects... \n', 'that sense that we are all connected.” The third principle is aparigraha, which is \n', 'living with a sense of enough. This principle focuses on sharing and completeness, \n', 'as a means to restore balance and achieve justice and fairness.\n', 'Shilpa has integrated all of these principles into her practice of activism \n', '– from awareness, to service, to advocacy, to teaching, to the creation of develop-\n', 'ment policy, to cocreating learning communities. This journey has taken her from \n', 'Chicago to the East Coast of the U.S., to India, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Iran, \n', 'Pakistan, Senegal, Malaysia, Thailand, Bolivia, Mexico—and back to the United \n', 'States, where she now roots herself in Berkeley, California.\n', 'For the last nine years, Shilpa has been the executive director of the nonprof-\n', 'it YES!

Instead, Shilpa has embraced a core YES! value: \n', 'that personal, interpersonal, and systemic change are all interconnected. “We \n', 'welcome different sectors of communities that have been disaffected...and try to \n', 'move the needle in a positive direction.

She experienced a similar revelation while teaching peace-making and \n', 'creative self- expression programs for at-risk youth. “These activities could only \n', 'serve as a band-aid for the attack on young peoples’ souls from the violence and \n', 'intensity of the school system and the larger world,” she says.\n', 'At the height of her frustration with trying to fix a broken world, in 1999, \n', 'Shilpa attended a conference on Gandhian education in New Delhi.

If you let go of the system, \n', 'if you organize around freedom and possibility and building the world we want, \n', 'the system will lose its power and you will regain yours.”\n', 'This revelation shifted Shilpa’s work as a “learning activist” at Shikshan-\n', 'tar: The Peoples’ Institute for Rethinking Education and Development, based \n', 'in Udaipur, India. She worked with Shikshantar’s cofounder and Shilpa’s elder \n', 'brother, Manish, and they were a powerful team for more than 10 years. It was \n', 'at Shikshantar that Shilpa was first able to see her way toward an integrated life, \n', '“where living is learning, and learning is living.” Through the work of Rabindranath Tag-\n', 'ore, known as “the Bard of India,” she studied creativity as a core aspect of self, \n', 'and collective, liberation. Shilpa integrated this learning by leading workshops \n', 'for children using theatre, art, and cooperative games as forms of self-expression, \n', 'collective communication, and vision development.\n', '“I had the chance to investigate and understand real-world crises and con-\n', 'flicts, from struggles against the building of big dams to the death of the small \n', 'farmer,” Shilpa explains. “I also was blessed to meet extraordinary people who, \n', 'maybe by others’ standards, might be called just ordinary.

And they suggested alternatives to plastic straws, like paper \n', 'straws, or reusable straws that people could carry with them. Jasper carries his \n', 'own stainless-steel straw in his backpack, and he keeps another one in his mom’s \n', 'car.\n', 'Sometimes the students’ reputation would precede them. One day they \n', 'visited the Black Dog Café, a popular restaurant located right next to the ferry \n', 'in Vineyard Haven. “We assumed that since it was such a big restaurant, they \n', 'wouldn’t want to help us,” Jasper says. But when they arrived there, the manager \n', 'was excited to see them: “Oh, great, Straw Free MV, we’ve been waiting for you!” \n', 'she said. She took all of their postcards, put them out on the tables; and asked \n', 'for more.\n', 'While reducing the use of plastic straws was an important first step, Jasper \n', 'knew there were other wasteful practices, like single-use plastic bottles of water \n', 'and soda, that needed to be addressed. With such a large tourist population, these \n', 'plastic bottles were everywhere on the island—strewn along the beaches, and fill-\n', 'ing up the recycling bins and landfills. “Plastic doesn’t just go away,” Jasper says. \n', '“Almost everything else breaks down and decomposes. But if you have a plastic \n', 'bottle that you use for just two seconds, it will be in the world for thousands of \n', 'years.”\n', 'So Jasper and his fellow youth activists set themselves a new goal. They \n', '245\n', 'developed a plan to introduce a bylaw that would forbid the selling of single-use \n', 'plastic bottles that held less than 34 ounces. They called their new group Plastic \n', 'Free MV, and they campaigned tirelessly for their cause.\n', 'To gain a broad base of support and build a strong grassroots movement, \n', 'they organized educational forums at the local libraries. They would put up post-\n', 'ers, set up chairs, and then share what they had learned through their research \n', 'with the audience. In their PowerPoint presentations, they gave a brief overview \n', 'of current climate science, and discussed how plastic production is accelerating \n', 'the climate crisis. “We are producing more than 300 million tons of plastic each \n', 'year, 50% of which is for single-use products,” reads one slide. “We can do better!” \n', 'says the next. After their presentations, they would open the forum up to debate. \n', '“We take time to answer people’s questions,” says Jasper. “It’s important to listen \n', 'to people’s opinions,” he adds. “The only way anything is achieved is by working \n', 'together.”\n', '“Sometimes people who come to the forums yell at us. They want their sin-\n', 'gle-use bottles! They want their convenience,” Jasper says. “We explain that it’s \n', 'really not about just one person—it’s about the whole world, and we all need to \n', 'help, because this is a major global issue.”\n', 'The next step for Jasper and his young changemakers was to present to the \n', 'selectmen and concerned citizens at the island’s town meetings, urging them to \n', 'adopt the new bylaw. So far three of the six towns have done so.\n', 'This work is not always easy, and not everyone is happy about the new rules. \n', '“Some businesses don’t really like the bylaw,” Jasper says. “If you are a store owner \n', 'or a distributor you can’t sell single-use plastic bottles under 34 oz. Some shops \n', 'would like to keep the plastic bottles; it’s been hard to get them on board.”\n', 'As these youth activists have learned, in the political world, it’s always \n', 'important to be on high alert. For more than a year, they’d been speaking at \n', 'selectmen meetings, carefully presenting their ideas, and respectively encouraging \n', 'dialogue about this issue. But then, when the time came to create the warrant for \n', 'the town meeting of Tisbury, the Board of Selectmen simply decided to take it off \n', 'the agenda. “One of our parents saw on Twitter that this happened,” says Jasper. \n', '“They ran right over to the meeting, and said, ‘Stop! You can’t do that!’” It took \n', 'three days of bickering, but eventually the bylaw was put back on the agenda for \n', 'the town meeting - to be held on June 13, 2020.\n', 'Jasper’s activism has now grown beyond Martha’s Vineyard. As a young \n', 'environmentalist, he knows how important it is to strengthen one’s network and \n', 'get in touch with other activists.

But when they see that \n', 'kids are standing up for something, it makes it look like it’s really important.”\n', 'Jasper is convinced that his activism, and that of his friends, can have a \n', 'large impact. He hopes that the changes made on Martha’s Vineyard will inspire \n', 'tourists to introduce sustainable practices in their own communities. “Maybe if \n', 'they see what we’re doing, they’ll go back to where they live, and they’ll say, ‘Hey, \n', 'why don’t we do something like that?’” Jasper says. “So, it can just spread.”\n', 'Young people, when informed and empowered, \n', 'when they realize that what they do truly makes a difference, \n', 'can indeed change the world.\n', 'Jane Goodall\n', 'Call to Action\n', ' Adopt sustainable practices in your life: Bring your own straw.

Her work was focused on \n', 'the Caribbean Islands, including St. Lucia and Belize—until Hurricane Maria \n', 'tore through the region in 2017. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane she \n', 'went to work in Puerto Rico, building microgrids in remote areas that had been \n', 'devastated. Microgrids are technologies that work with existing energy grids, but \n', 'continue working when the energy grid goes down–a commonplace occurrence \n', 'in the remote mountainous regions of Puerto Rico, which became the norm after \n', 'Hurricane Maria.\n', 'It’s estimated that Hurricane Maria caused Puerto Rico roughly $91 billion \n', 'in damages.

So she partnered with several organizations such as Save The Children, \n', 'to install renewable microgrid infrastructure in schools, including the schools in \n', 'mountainous communities, which were experiencing the longest outages.

He’d \n', 'read about Dr. Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in 1983 to \n', 'provide micro-credit loans to entrepreneurs, mostly women, in Bangladesh, and \n', 'who had gone on to win the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. “Access to finance was the \n', 'main barrier people always came up against,” Gary says. “They understood the \n', 'issues their communities were facing and what approach was needed to remedy \n', 'their issues. They just didn’t have any savings to do it. In rural areas, the issue is \n', 'usually access to water and the tradeoff is time. A few hours’ walk might get you \n', 'water, but a six-hour walk will get you higher quality water. In either case, there’s \n', 'a lot of cost associated with all of that in lost time. Water Partners has worked to \n', 'alleviate that with our microloan program.”\n', 'In urban areas, the tradeoffs manifest a bit differently. “When there’s no \n', 'water available, people have to pay vendors 10-15 times the amount they’d pay if \n', 'they had the money to get a direct connection to their local utility. The problem \n', 'is that many people may have just $1 a day to buy water from the vendor, but not \n', '$300 to get the necessary connection. So they have to wait in long lines at public \n', 'water faucets, which is another time sink. This is where loans can help in the long \n', 'term.”\n', '257\n', 'Gary quickly realized that the biggest bottleneck was getting access to whole-\n', 'sale capital, which he would need in order to get help to all the people who needed \n', 'it. The problem was just too big to be addressed through microloans.\n', 'As fate would have it, Gary met Matt Damon in 2008 at the Clinton Global \n', 'Initiative. At that time, Matt had been running an organization called H20 Africa, \n', 'which helped supply people with drinking water in rural Africa. After talking with \n', 'Gary, Matt realized that Water Partners had a track record of doing what he was \n', 'trying to do, and he had the name and brand that could help them gain access to \n', 'new and greater levels of funding. They realized that working together they could \n', 'change the future of water. And so, with equally lofty goals in mind, they merged \n', 'their organizations to form Water.org and Water Equity, an investment capital \n', 'project and a sister organization that they hope will be able to scale the work of \n', 'Water.org through wholesale capital.\n', 'Water.org and Water Equity have grown to include a committed team of \n', 'corporate philanthropy and engagement partners helping to provide microloans \n', 'to those in need, including the World Bank, Caterpillar, Mastercard Foundation, \n', 'Ikea, the Bank of America, Pepsi, and the UN General Assembly.\n', 'Gary and Matt are leaders in a new generation of social entrepreneurs who \n', 'are viewing problems like urban and rural water resilience, water scarcity, and \n', 'water-stressed communities through a progressive lens. “To me, social entrepre-\n', 'neurship is basically looking at some of society’s biggest and most overlooked chal-\n', 'lenges and trying to apply more innovative and creative solutions to them,” Gary \n', 'says, pointing out that in hubs like Silicon Valley, it’s of the utmost importance \n', 'for entrepreneurs to fuel value creation. “When you apply that type of mindset \n', 'and ingenuity to social problems, we can remake the world for the better. As a \n', 'global community, we should agree to apply the same level of talent and ingenuity \n', 'to social issues as we do to getting out the newest iPhone.” Gary hopes that his \n', 'work has raised awareness and inspired more people to get involved working on \n', 'a solution to Sustainable Development Goal 6: clean water and sanitation for all.\n', 'In his travels to rural places, Gary noticed that accessing water has a variety \n', 'of social ramifications he’d never really considered—like girls’ education, which is \n', 'among the most concerning. Not having reliable access to water keeps girls out of \n', 'school disproportionately. “In a lot of rural areas, if a family needs somebody to \n', 'spend hours every day waiting in line fetching water, they usually end up sending \n', 'a girl. So they don’t get to spend as much time learning, and occasionally they \n', 'stop going to school altogether.” This is one of the most important reasons to get \n', 'reliable water sources close to peoples’ homes, so that girls can go to school.\n', ' 258\n', 'Perhaps the most widespread and least discussed impact of climate change \n', 'is in terms of water resources and water scarcity. Gary sees climate change as \n', 'potentially preventing hundreds of millions of people getting and maintaining \n', 'access to clean water. “We know that climate change is contributing to stronger \n', 'and more frequent floods, which are occurring with greater irregularity. This puts \n', 'the most vulnerable among us in a very precarious situation. And flooding also \n', 'raises sea levels, which can contaminate wells and make them unusable.” It can \n', 'also interfere with infrastructure, making communities that have gained access to \n', 'water less water resilient. “The way this problem manifests itself mostly is through \n', 'water,” Gary says. “We need to ensure that our communities are resilient enough \n', 'to tolerate the negative effects of climate change in the future.”\n', 'For young people interested in social entrepreneurship, Gary believes that \n', 'education is the first responsibility of any venture that is trying to make a lasting \n', 'impact on the world. “The first thing to do is to study up on sustainability issues \n', 'and understand them inside and out. As you go through that process, you are \n', 'going to see a lot of things that may stand in the way.”\n', 'Gary believes the best way to get overcome these obstacles is by connecting \n', 'with a like-minded community. “In any venture, it’s important to look for people \n', 'who are trying to work on the same problem, and get together with them to try \n', 'and push your shared concept forward. That’s where entrepreneurship comes in. \n', 'Most people individually can see a current problem and how to solve it now. But \n', 'it takes a lot of people working together and looking at what is going to be the \n', 'best way to fix these problems two or three years from now to fully realize what’s \n', 'needed to make that happen.”\n', 'Gary has an inspiring question he says young entrepreneurs should ask of \n', 'themselves. “Once you have the data and the community, it’s time to ask yourself, \n', 'Why not? If there’s a gap that corporations and organizations aren’t able to fill, it’s \n', 'incumbent upon you to fill that gap.” He adds, “I encourage the youth sustain-\n', 'ability leaders and entrepreneurs to go out and try to implement creative solutions \n', 'to the climate crisis.

Not surprisingly, in carrying out this tradition Ben \n', 'Smilowitz has become a leading name in innovative disaster relief efforts.\n', 'By the time Ben was in elementary school, he was already on the path to \n', 'becoming involved in his community and bringing about positive change. “In the \n', 'first or second grade I knocked on my state senator’s door, selling oranges and \n', 'grapefruits for a school fundraiser,” Ben says, recalling his youthful efforts. When \n', 'the senator asked him to get involved in his campaign, Ben’s lifelong foray into \n', 'civic engagement had begun.\n', 'In no time, Ben was touring the state capitol with the senator, learning the \n', 'ropes, and handing out flyers for causes he wanted to support. All the while he \n', 'was asking questions about policies and agendas that he didn’t yet understand. He \n', 'quickly became versed in the workings of local politics thanks to mentoring from \n', 'forward-looking campaigners and staff. And by the age of 8 he had started to \n', 'develop a practical toolkit for impacting local change.\n', 'Next he aimed to get his peers involved. When he was 16 years old, “I read \n', 'that someone had resigned on the state Board of Education,” Ben recalls. “I wrote \n', 'the governor a letter and asked him to appoint a young person.” He wrote a press \n', ' 260\n', 'release announcing that he was launching a campaign to fill the vacant seat with \n', 'a young person. Even though an adult was appointed to that seat, Ben didn’t let \n', 'it deter him.\n', 'He then launched a new campaign to add student seats to the board. This \n', 'time around, he ramped up his efforts. He held public hearings, lobbied, and \n', 'organized multiple press conferences with the media to get the word out. “We \n', 'got about 50 students from across the state to write letters. We created a petition \n', 'and got a few thousand signatures. And then we had about 20 students attend \n', 'our rally, and another 15 students went to the state capitol to lobby. A year and a \n', 'month after our first letter to the governor, we had a bill signing.” Ben and a few \n', 'other students were in the gallery watching the vote, which passed 145 to 0. The \n', 'standing ovation, for a bill Ben had written, brought all of their combined efforts \n', 'to heart. “It was a successful grassroots campaign in every sense, with passion and \n', 'collaboration every step of the way,” Ben says.\n', 'Ben went on to champion a variety of other issues. He founded the Inter-\n', 'national Student Activism Alliance, which aimed to organize young people in \n', 'communities across the country to serve as a student watchdog group, represent-\n', 'ing students’ rights and public education issues. And in Missouri, he helped create \n', 'the nation’s first Youth Cabinet, in which all the cabinet positions were occupied \n', 'by youth.\n', 'No matter what issue he gets involved in, Ben’s message is always about \n', 'getting youth and local communities to act in support of public service. When \n', 'asked what youth need to do to make progress on causes important to them, he \n', 'says, “They need the trust of others. They need validation that they are on the \n', 'right track, that they have the power to do what they’re doing, and that they \n', 'should pursue their ideas.”\n', 'In 2005, when Ben was 24, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the south-\n', 'eastern U.S., wreaking havoc anywhere it touched down. In the immediate af-\n', 'termath of this national emergency Ben decided to volunteer for the American \n', 'Red Cross in Gulfport, Mississippi. And at ground zero, he assisted in a very real, \n', 'practical sense.\n', 'When he first arrived, he noticed from the start that something didn’t seem \n', 'right. Inexperienced, first-time volunteers were being assigned to entire sites with \n', 'extremely difficult, expansive, tough tasks that they weren’t equipped to manage. \n', 'There was little to no accounting of what was being distributed, and to whom. \n', 'This created massive queues: mothers with babies waited in long, hot lines, without \n', 'attention. People with disabilities were suffering and too often neglected. Medical \n', '261\n', 'professionals were unlicensed to operate. Worst of all, in a multiethnic, multiracial \n', 'area, hate groups showed up to intimidate those receiving aid. After experiencing \n', 'all this suffering, Ben learned one of the hardest lessons of his life: sometimes \n', 'there are great obstacles that lie in the way of doing good.\n', '“Don’t get me wrong,” he explains, describing the bungled relief efforts. \n', '“People were extremely generous. Americans and people from other countries do-\n', 'nated all they could to help. However, that aid just wasn’t reaching the people that \n', 'needed it most. I realized that a lot of things could be improved to help more peo-\n', 'ple. We were there to help the people in Mississippi who had lost everything...So, \n', 'I spoke up—and broke policy, by allowing the media to see the mismanagement \n', 'at hand. For the sake of the people who were suffering, I needed them to see what \n', 'the actual needs were on the ground, compared with what we were providing...It \n', 'was tough to point a critical eye at those trying to help those in need. However, if \n', 'they weren’t helping, and were even exacerbating the pain, I felt it just wasn’t right \n', 'for it to go on unchecked.”\n', 'Recognizing the inherent flaws in a system that was trying to fundraise, ex-\n', 'ecute, and coordinate a relief effort simultaneously in the immediate wake of a \n', 'natural disaster like Katrina, Ben saw another way. He knew that with a little \n', 'planning, and a lot of hard work, he could influence the system to work with much \n', 'greater efficiency and help more people more effectively.\n', '“My initial reaction when I got back home was to ask ‘Who is accountable? \n', 'And how do we prevent such mismanagement from happening again?’” He de-\n', 'cided the best way was to start a nonpartisan watchdog organization focused on \n', 'accountability in relief situations. Out of the ashes of his Katrina experience was \n', 'born the Disaster Accountability Project (DAP).\n', 'The three primary issues DAP addresses are 1. Improve the effectiveness of \n', 'disaster relief and humanitarian aid; 2. Make sure help reaches those that need it \n', 'most; and 3. Make sure lessons are learned so we do not make the same mistakes, \n', 'disaster after disaster. DAP has made assessments in the wakes of earthquakes in \n', 'Haiti (2010), Japan (2011), and Nepal (2015).\n', 'In October-November 2012, Superstorm Sandy devastated the eastern \n', 'United States, inflicting tremendous damage on the coastal regions. By the time \n', 'the storm had passed, there were 233 fatalities, $68.7 billion of damage, and over \n', '305,000 homes were lost in New York alone. DAP filed a successful complaint in \n', 'New York against the American Red Cross for gross mismanagement, and won \n', '$4 million, to be released to survivors of Superstorm Sandy. Large victories like \n', 'this, won by such a comparatively small organization, show just how significant a \n', ' 262\n', 'positive impact a few dedicated individuals can make for the people most in need.\n', 'DAP was the first organization of its kind in the industry, and Ben knew \n', 'it was making a significant impact in the world of disaster relief. As a result of \n', 'DAP’s work, millions of misappropriated funds have been recouped, and that aid \n', 'has been reappropriated to the individuals that it was promised to in the wake of \n', 'emergency situations.\n', 'Ever the innovator, Ben knew there was still more he could do to make a \n', 'bigger impact. He understood that having oversight was great, and the result-\n', 'ing accountability was necessary for improving processes and results. But what if \n', 'there were an aspect of the disaster relief cycle that, if addressed, could signifi-\n', 'cantly reduce the number of negative outcomes in the first place? With this ques-\n', 'tion in mind, Ben created yet another answer, in the form of an online system:  \n', 'SmartResponse.org.\n', 'SmartResponse.org is an interactive data repository: through this platform, \n', 'people can identify the local organizations responding to disasters and support \n', 'them directly. “If we can preemptively curate a list of organizations operating \n', 'locally, we can effectively direct donations to deserving local organizations at the \n', 'most critical times. We really want to change how money moves after disasters \n', 'and put the power into the hands of local groups.”\n', 'SmartResponse.org helps to get much needed funds quickly to local food \n', 'banks, community and cultural organizations, disability rights groups, and other \n', 'entities that will be there after the smoke clears and the media’s cameras leave. \n', '“They have the numbers on the ground to react to different situations. This type \n', 'of response strengthens the local economies affected, creates and protects jobs, \n', 'and ensures that money and efforts are also invested into future preparedness and \n', 'mitigation efforts.”\n', 'Given the increasing number of disasters in the world due to climate change, \n', 'both DAP and SmartReponse.org have been well received by local communi-\n', 'ties. DAP is now in its thirteenth year of operation, and SmartResponse.org has \n', 'aligned with more than 600 participating organizations from 58 countries.\n', 'While organizations like DAP and SmartResponse.org have made signifi-\n', 'cant positive impacts in disaster response and relief efforts, they both started with \n', 'a first step.\n', 'What can other young people do to help? “Think about what issues or caus-\n', 'es you are passionate about, then get involved,” Ben says. “Volunteer.

Bali beaches are famous among \n', 'tourists for their beauty - clean, white sand beaches as far as the eye can see. How-\n', 'ever many of these gorgeous beaches are increasingly being covered with plastic \n', 'litter—from water bottles to straws, and single use products.\n', 'Each week they picked up the litter hoping they could help return it to its \n', 'natural state of beauty. At first Gary thought that the beaches would stay that way. \n', 'But the very next day, there was more trash – plastic waste everywhere. Week after \n', 'week, more plastic kept appearing on the shores.\n', ' 264\n', 'Gary soon realized the sheer volume of garbage on the beaches couldn’t just \n', 'be from tourists and local people littering. It was a much bigger problem. And as it \n', 'turned out, he was right: it was an upstream issue. He soon discovered that Bali’s \n', 'rivers were actually the source of the plastic pollution. People living along Bali’s \n', 'rivers were using them as a garbage dump, since they was no waste management \n', 'system, nor any green alternatives. So Gary and his brother Sam started rallying \n', 'volunteers to clean up plastic pollution from the beaches. They formed Make A \n', 'Change Bali to explore ways to help clean up the riverways.\n', 'Gary was curious to see if other countries had this problem too. They were \n', 'shocked to learn that 150 million metric tons of plastic are in our oceans, and 8 \n', 'million metric tons of plastic waste are added each year – and a sizeable percent-\n', 'age of this waste is from river sources. So Gary and Sam expanded their local \n', 'organization to create Make A Change World to address this problem globally. \n', 'What made their second venture different from their first is that they now decided \n', 'it was equally important to focus on education – knowing that if people didn’t un-\n', 'derstand the consequences of their habits, then they’d have no reason to change \n', 'to greener lifestyle choices. And Gary felt that the best way to educate people \n', 'about the environmental crisis is through film.\n', 'So Gary embarked on an adventure: first he moved to New York to attend \n', 'film school at the New York Film Academy. In conversations with Americans, he \n', 'noticed the same lack of awareness around plastic pollution that he had found \n', 'in Bali – rivers were largely being ignored as a source of ocean pollution. So he \n', 'decided to make his first film about the Mississippi River, the longest river in the \n', 'United States, which runs right through the center of America’s heartland.\n', 'He decided that linking his film with one of the most famous characters \n', 'in American literature, Huckleberry Finn, would be a good way to get people’s \n', 'attention. So he sailed the 2,300 mile length of the Mississippi River on a raft \n', 'constructed of 800 plastic bottles, and created a short documentary series to raise \n', 'awareness of this problem.\n', 'Gary named his raft “Ioco” and he put together a team of skilled engineers, \n', 'who took readings about the health of the river’s water as they traveled. What they \n', 'discovered was frightening. There were unsafe levels of microplastics, extremely \n', 'tiny particles of plastics, in nearly every area they tested. This type of pollution \n', 'is toxic to the fish and harmful to the humans who eat them. “My purpose in \n', 'making the film was to show the problem visually,” he says. “But since you can’t \n', 'see microplastics, you can only measure them, that wasn’t successful in raising \n', 'awareness.”\n', '265\n', 'Thankfully, this problem didn’t stop Gary.\n', 'To get his message across, Gary knew he had to find a way to create a great \n', 'visual. So, as he searched for a great visual image that would inspire action, he \n', 'learned, much to his dismay, that the most polluted river in the world was in his \n', 'very own backyard, in Indonesia.\n', 'The stretch of the Citarum River in West Java is the textile capital of the \n', 'world. There the factories of the world’s largest clothing companies are dumping \n', 'dyes and other pollutants directly into the water, in alarming amounts. To raise \n', 'awareness of this catastrophic issue, Gary and his brother Sam made another film \n', 'as they sailed down the river on two boats made of recycled plastic.\n', 'Downstream from the factories, they saw the water tainted with artificial \n', 'colors from the dyes, dead animals floating in the water, and piles of burning \n', 'trash. What was most shocking to them was that the river was entirely covered in \n', 'plastic. With every stroke of their paddles, their oars would hit another bottle. “It \n', 'really hit me how far we’ve come in the destruction of our planet,” Gary says. “I \n', 'just wanted to do everything I possibly could, every day of my life, to clean the \n', 'environment and save the planet.”\n', 'Gary and Sam’s first video went viral overnight. “Our little journey, travel-\n', 'ing on a raft of plastic bottles, became international news,” Gary says. “We were \n', 'speechless! We were finally starting to get the attention that this movement needs.”\n', 'People all over the world began messaging Gary and Sam online to find \n', 'out ways they could help. Four months later, the brothers were invited to meet \n', 'with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. They talked about the urgency of the \n', 'Citarum’s situation and he assured them that he would personally see to it that \n', 'they receive help to address the problem. Gary and Sam were very pleased when \n', 'he declared a “garbage emergency” a few months later. In February 2018, he \n', 'mobilized 7,000 military troops for a cleanup campaign, with a seven-year com-\n', 'mitment. Gary joined in, with check-ins every 2-4 months, to see the progress that \n', 'was being made, and to learn from the cleanup effort what he could bring to the \n', 'rest of the world.\n', 'One day while observing the workers, who were both troops and technical \n', 'experts from the Ministry, Gary had an idea for a new kind of monitoring process. \n', 'What if we could measure the things we can see—like plastic bottles-as well as the things we \n', 'can’t see—like lead, uranium, and toxic chemicals in the water? he asked himself. Would that \n', 'make a difference? He envisioned this new system as a way to exchange knowledge \n', 'and best practices from the global community, who’d been reaching out to him in \n', 'droves, wanting to help.\n', ' 266\n', 'Sungai Watch is an open-source online platform that uses geographic soft-\n', 'ware like GIS and AI to track ocean cleanup in real time. It then provides data \n', 'on what pollutants are in the water. This allows scientists to determine which \n', 'cleanup methods – barriers, skimmers, or other technologies—are most effective. \n', 'This open sourcing of environmental solutions encourages the global community \n', 'to share both data and technologies, so that effective solutions can benefit more \n', 'communities, and can become refined through applying collective wisdom.\n', '“It’s exciting, exchanging ideas and methods from around the world,” Gary \n', 'says. “But to be most effective, we really need local communities to inform our \n', 'work.” The local communities he works with span from Jakarta to Singapore and \n', 'beyond. And it’s in these local communities that he’s found valuable knowledge \n', 'about things that he didn’t know about prior. For example, they know the local \n', 'irrigation channels, and how seasonal things, like monsoons, can impact places \n', 'on the equator. “The monsoon effect causes cities on the equator to produce a \n', 'disproportionate amount of plastic pollution, because when the rivers swell, it \n', 'sends garbage into the oceans. These are the kinds of things we’re now learning \n', 'from people around the world.” He adds, “Now more than ever, we need our \n', 'global community to inform our decision making.”\n', 'For young people looking to make an impact on the environment, Gary has \n', 'two main messages. One is that positivity bridges all divides. “We learned early on \n', 'to always take a positive approach,” he says. “No pointing fingers. This isn’t about \n', 'blame, it’s about finding solutions. We want to help, and we don’t want anybody \n', 'to feel as if they need to apologize.”\n', 'Gary also believes that big, far-reaching ideas are what the movement needs \n', 'most. “No idea is too crazy!” he says. “We need big ideas, and we need risk takers \n', 'to go above and beyond to put these wild and crazy ideas into action. That’s the \n', 'only way for us make sure we sustain the planet for future generations.”\n', 'As a filmmaker, Gary is always thinking of new ways to get his environ-\n', 'mental message out to the world. One day, with his brother Sam, they had an \n', 'idea for another way they could raise awareness – and that was to run across the \n', 'United States. He realized that people living in “middle America” might not feel \n', 'very connected to the problems of the ocean.

We support world leaders to champion solar, \n', 'acting as a catalyst for wider adoption of new solutions for renewable energy.”\n', '269\n', 'This small organization made waves with its campaign to install solar panels \n', 'on the White House during Barack Obama’s presidency, and James was brought \n', 'on board later as a cofounder. “I don’t believe in starting up new organizations for \n', 'the sake of it,” he says. “I really believe that this was an opportunity to grow an \n', 'existing campaign that had stalled and help take it to new heights.”\n', 'Solar Head of State also made a big splash when they partnered with the \n', 'President of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed. The Maldives, a small island de-\n', 'veloping state (SIDS), is a chain of islands in the Indian Ocean whose highest point \n', 'is just 2 meters; they’ve been seriously impacted by coastal sea rising and even a \n', 'tsunami. Nasheed, who was featured in the movie The Island President, dramatically \n', 'showed the precarious situation of his country by holding a cabinet meeting un-\n', 'derwater, fully dressed in scuba gear. He also made sure that the Maldives was the \n', 'first country to install solar power at an executive residence.\n', 'Other island nations, from Jamaica to St. Lucia, have followed Nasheed’s \n', 'lead. Over the next two years, 12 new solar installations are lined up for Pacific \n', 'Island nations. The Youth Solar Challenge, put on by Solar Head of State and the \n', 'Caribbean Youth Environment Network, invites young people to create unique \n', 'communications campaigns, to educate their communities about green energy. \n', 'Successful campaigns in Jamaica and Guyana have already been implemented, \n', 'with more to come.

He points to a recent Yale study \n', 'that showed that community leaders who install solar in their homes convince \n', '62 percent more residents to join them vs. those who didn’t. According to James \n', 'another problem is that too often scientists and techies miss the “soft skills” needed \n', 'to get their message across. He uses his communication and collaboration skills to \n', 'bridge this gap.\n', 'His experiences with Solar Head of State challenged James to delve deeply \n', 'into finding solutions for the problems small island nations face. He discovered \n', 'that they have similar challenges: building roads and schools; recovering from nat-\n', 'ural disasters; developing sustainable trade practices; and dealing with the isola-\n', 'tion of their remote locations. Most significant is the challenge of creating reliable \n', 'alternative energy resources. “Take, for example, the Caribbean,” James explains. \n', '“On average, they pay 3-6 times more for electricity than Americans. This leads \n', 'to “energy poverty”—people who just can’t afford it. And it’s not reliable when \n', 'it’s frequently bombarded by tropical storms with high winds, rains, and flying \n', 'debris.” He adds, “Since islands are the most vulnerable to climate change, it’s \n', 'important to have alternative ways to provide energy, in case of a disaster.”\n', ' 270\n', 'When he was 24 James’s journey led him back to the U.K. to attend the \n', 'University of Highlands and Islands in Northern Scotland. “The conversations \n', 'happening on Caribbean islands are also happening on Scottish islands,” James \n', 'says. “Issues of energy poverty, rural infrastructure, and communication were the \n', 'same, halfway across the globe. That’s when the lightbulb went off!”\n', 'From his travels, James had gained a unique vantage point on how things \n', 'operate in different countries. He knew how to interact with governments and \n', 'their communities, and how to get investors. He’d seen that solar technology \n', 'means different things to different communities. In East Africa where the poor \n', 'use solar, it has a lower-class stigma. This makes it hard to convince people that \n', 'the technology is worthwhile. “If we want to expand renewable energy, we need \n', 'to understand where the needs are different, and where they are the same,” James \n', 'says. “An island-networking community!” And that is how Island Innovation was \n', 'born.\n', '“Islands are particularly vulnerable to climate change,” James explains. “A \n', 'single event can knock out an island’s economy. A hurricane won’t affect 100 \n', 'percent of the U.S., but it clobbered Puerto Rico. Island people need to work \n', 'together and learn from each other. What works, what doesn’t work.

How can Scotland \n', 'have a conversation about sustainability with Jamaica?” He developed the Virtual \n', 'Island Summit, a free annual online event, connecting global island communities \n', 'on a common digital platform. During the Summit, people from around the world \n', 'come together virtually, to share ideas, innovations, and the best practices they’ve \n', 'come up with to deal with the challenges of island communities.\n', 'When the inaugural Summit was held in October 2019, world-class experts \n', 'shared their knowledge with more than 100 island communities from the Arctic \n', '271\n', 'to the Pacific Islands and beyond.

A turbine of this size would be able to satisfy 15 percent of \n', 'the energy needs for the island’s middle and high schools with a clean, renewable \n', 'source of energy: wind power.\n', 'First, they would have to overcome many obstacles.

Many of the \n', 'shellfish raised—like mussels, oysters, and clams—are especially vulnerable to \n', 'extreme weather conditions. “If the waters increase in temperature, the growing \n', 'season increases,” Perry explains. “That means the amount of time the oysters \n', 'can be stressed increases, since most of the stress occurs during the summer. So \n', 'more extreme weather increases the occurrences of the conditions that can lead \n', 'to disease and ultimately, mortality. There are benefits to being a little inland on \n', 'a pond, as opposed to on the coast. It’s protected. But climate change poses great \n', 'risks no matter where you are.”\n', 'With his $200,000 a year business, Perry employs more than 200 people \n', 'at his very popular restaurant, many of whom started out as shuckers. But he is \n', 'much more than just an entrepreneur. On summer mornings, he takes local youth \n', 'out on his boat so they can observe firsthand the life of an oysterman. In the fall, \n', 'he serves as a mentor for the Coastal Fellows program at the University of Rhode \n', 'Island. And for the last 11 years, every spring his oyster bar has held an annual \n', 'Earth Day beach cleanup at East Matunuck State Beach.\n', '279\n', '“Since before the restaurant started, we’ve been taking volunteers to the \n', 'beach, the salt marshes, and Succotash Salt Pond,” he says. “We pick up all the \n', 'trash lined up on our shore. The amount of debris we’ve cleaned up is just been \n', 'amazing. Over the years, it’s really added up. It’s become a community staple. It’s \n', 'something we will always do.”\n', 'Perry believes it’s very important for young people with an interest in sus-\n', 'tainability to get involved any way they can. “If you want to know how something \n', 'works, ask questions,” he says. “Track down people who are doing what you want \n', 'to do and learn from them. Find a farm, and work or volunteer with them. Attend \n', 'trade shows. Read up on things. And look for funded opportunities. There are \n', 'always grants and internships, as a way in for young entrepreneurs. Aquaculture \n', 'is not an easy field; it’s farming. But it’s very rewarding.”\n', 'In regard to his own personal journey, Perry credits the many mentors who \n', 'guided him toward being a leader in sustainable aquaculture. “At every stage, I \n', 'myself asked a lot of questions,” he says. “I went to a lot of conferences. I stud-\n', 'ied under and collaborated with a lot of great professors at the University of \n', 'Rhode Island. Dr. Michael Rice. Dr. Dave Bengston. And of course, Dr. Marta \n', 'Gomez-Chiarri, with whom I still work today. They’ve all done so much for me \n', '– but I was willing to humble myself and put in the work to learn. You can’t have \n', 'one without the other and expect to be an overnight success.”\n', 'That said, Perry feels that it’s important for people to become as familiar \n', 'with aquaculture as they are with other type of farms. “We need to make more \n', 'people aware that aquaculture is a good use of our water bodies. It’s also a great \n', 'use of the public trust. Our water bodies are owned by all Rhode Islanders. As \n', 'of now, I think it’s viewed as more of a niche industry. But I want to change this. \n', 'Aquaculture should be viewed in the same way as sustainable agriculture. Then \n', 'we can really make an impact.”\n', 'If there’s anybody capable of bringing aquaculture into the mainstream, \n', 'surely, it’s Perry. It’s a big ask. But there’s no reason to think he’s done innovating \n', 'yet. He’s already done a great deal for the sustainability movement, and given \n', 'back to his community more than he could possibly know.\n', 'That includes his father, who in Perry has surely seen his dream come true. \n', 'And there’s no telling what great dreams and people he will continue to inspire.\n', 'No fishermen, no fish.\n', 'Lailah Gifty Akita\n', ' 280\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Visit Perry at the Matunuck Oyster Bar at www. rhodyoysters.com \n'], 'tags': [[279, 'agriculture farm-to-table/pond-to-table approach'], [280, 'Akita, Lailah Gifty'], [279, 'animals effects of climate change on'], [278, 'aquaculture'], [279, 'cleanup campaigns beach'], [279, 'climate change impact on animals'], [279, 'farm-to-table/pond-to-table agriculture'], [277, 'food industry sustainable businesses'], [279, 'Matunuck Oyster Bar'], [278, 'Matunuck Oyster Farm'], [278, 'oceans aquaculture'], [279, 'organic farming'], [278, 'oysters'], [277, 'Raso, Perry'], [278, 'sustainable aquaculture'], [278, 'sustainable business models food industry']]}, '62': {'person': 'Elliot Connor', 'title': 'Human Nature Projects', 'start_page_number': '281', 'end_page_number': '285', 'story': ['Human Nature Projects\n', 'Elliot Connor | Australia\n', 'It was a clear night in northern Botswana. Ten-year-old Elliot and his family \n', 'had set up camp for the night, with their tents grouped around a little campfire. \n', 'There was nothing around, except the infinite expanse of the veld, the stars in the \n', 'clear night sky, and the sounds of the bush. Elliot was trotting along behind his \n', 'parents and his big brother, on the way back from the campground bathroom to \n', 'their tents.\n', 'Suddenly, he sensed a movement behind him, and he froze—they were in \n', 'the wilderness after all. There were all sorts of animals around. He turned around \n', 'slowly.\n', '“There, about two meters behind me, was a young leopard, crouched quite \n', 'low to the ground,” Elliott remembers. “It was stalking me.”\n', 'For three never-ending seconds, Elliot looked right into the leopard’s eyes. \n', 'Luckily, at that very moment, his older brother turned around, flashlight in hand. \n', 'The beam of light scared the leopard away; but for the rest of the night Elliot and \n', 'his family stayed in their tent while the leopard kept circling the camp site. His \n', 'father stood guard by the fire, with a bottle of wine and a shovel in his hands.\n', 'Elliot would never forget this encounter with the leopard. From the time he \n', 'was a small child, animals had been an important part of his life. His parents were \n', 'passionate bird watchers and he often tagged along with them, using their old \n', 'camera gear to take pictures. When his family moved from the U.K. to Australia \n', '281\n', 'when he was five, his passion for animals only continued to grow.\n', 'But as he grew older, he realized that animal species around the world face \n', 'a lethal enemy. Human activities have decimated natural habitats and changed \n', 'the climate, which causes many species to go extinct. According to UN estimates, \n', 'about 200 plant, insect, bird, and mammal species are disappearing from our \n', 'planet every day.\n', 'To fight this trend, conservationists around the world are trying to educate \n', 'people about the need for saving endangered species. When he was 15, Elliott \n', 'decided that he wanted to turn his passion for animals into doing something. So \n', 'he started volunteering with the Birdlife Australia Discovery Center, which was \n', 'just around the corner from a local park in Sydney. But soon he understood that \n', 'there was a long way to go.\n', '“It was quite a shock for me,” he says. “All the volunteers were at least 70 \n', 'years old. And there were almost no visitors coming through.”\n', 'Elliott was appalled to see how isolated the field of conservationism was in \n', 'Australia. So, six months later, he decided to start his own club for naturalists. It \n', 'was the first of its kind in Sydney. The main purpose of it was just to try to inspire \n', 'more people to go outside and experience nature. He also joined many other \n', 'organizations, and volunteered wherever he could. In fact, he put in more than \n', '300 hours of volunteering in just12 months—but in all that time, he never met \n', 'anyone his age.\n', 'His volunteer work also took him abroad. In January 2019, Elliot was work-\n', 'ing in a rescue center for raptors and hedgehogs in southern France. One night he \n', 'was doing research into various conservationist organizations, when he realized \n', 'that many of the websites he was looking at were decades old. A lot of the organi-\n', 'zations had ceased operations, and even the well-established ones were struggling \n', 'to incorporate young volunteers.\n', '“It was very difficult for me as a minor, to work my way into these organiza-\n', 'tions so I could gain experience,” he remembers. “That is sort of what triggered \n', 'it for me.”\n', 'Taking long winter walks through the beautiful landscape of southern France, \n', 'he started wondering what could be done to get young people involved in con-\n', 'servationism. “That’s where a lot of the philosophy for Human Nature Projects \n', 'came about,” he says. “It’s designed as an entry point for volunteers. We’re trying \n', 'to promote it as a very accessible, engaging, community form of conservation.”\n', 'For Elliot, it was the beginning of a very exciting project: in June 2019, he \n', ' 282\n', 'officially founded his organization, Human Nature Projects. It has quickly grown \n', 'into a decentralized network of more than 1,400 activists in 110 countries. “We \n', 'want to empower each of our volunteers as an individual, and help them create \n', 'the impact that they want to make,” Elliot explains. “But we also recognize the \n', 'power of the collective.”\n', 'The semi-independent country teams organize their own outreach and \n', 'fundraising efforts, and projects, which ensures that their activities have the biggest \n', 'possible impact on the local level. The teams organize a wide range of activities: \n', 'the Australian team has just started a campaign on bush fires, while the team in \n', 'the Congo is focusing on climate change, and volunteers in Uganda are fighting \n', 'to rescue chimpanzees.\n', '“I think it just goes to show the power of being able to link up such passionate \n', 'youth leaders, and supporting and engaging them in this process,” Elliot says.\n', 'For Elliot, who describes himself as an introvert, it was hard to take the \n', 'initial step of presenting his ideas and his vision to a wider audience. “The biggest \n', 'challenge was having the confidence in myself, being able to just put myself out \n', 'there,” he says. “In a sense, I just needed to have the ambition to aim for some-\n', 'thing so large.”\n', 'But even during the very first meetings with other activists for Human Na-\n', 'ture Projects, Elliot felt that he had created something that could inspire others, \n', 'not just himself. “It was an amazing realization that I was able to speak with peo-\n', 'ple all around the globe,” he remembers. “That’s something I never even dreamed \n', 'of. I’m very introverted myself, I never took on leadership roles in school.”\n', 'But Elliot is dedicated to the issue: when he first started his project, he would \n', 'work on it after school, from 5 pm until 9 pm, trying to learn more about the \n', 'underlying problems at night. It was tiring, and in the beginning, responses to his \n', 'outreach work were slow to come in.\n', '“You just have to have the perseverance to move on,” Elliot says. “You have \n', 'to find new routes, be creative about how you set about projects like this.”\n', 'Elliot knew for sure that the issue of conservationism needed a new ap-\n', 'proach, and a new generation to take up the fight. Being a resource- poor field, \n', 'conservation projects often struggle with a lack of funding. But there are also \n', 'issues of duplicated efforts and miscommunication, he says.\n', '“We need to redefine how we’re measuring our impact,” he says. “We need \n', 'to work through the people first. We need a community-centric model of conser-\n', 'vation. This means changing the perspective of communities—which is obviously \n', '283\n', 'the root cause of these problems.”\n', 'That is why Elliot came up with the four C’s of conservation: Connection, \n', 'Curiosity, Creativity, and Collaboration. For him, it is all about educating and \n', 'engaging people in the fight for animals, and changing their perspective on nature.\n', '“Increasingly, we’re learning that animals are just as intelligent, just as com-\n', 'plex as we are,” he says. “My life goal is reframing our relationship with nature. I \n', 'think if we can reevaluate what it means to be human, then that is the ideal way \n', 'to be able to live alongside animals.”\n', 'It is therefore a central part of Elliot’s work to make people appreciate the \n', 'nature around them and build a community around a positive message on conser-\n', 'vation. “The positive side of things is often lost when we talk about conservation,” \n', 'he says. “In order to get people involved in the cause, you need a positive message \n', 'about how we all can contribute our share to saving nature.”\n', 'Elliot’s Human Nature Projects is a successful example of this approach. \n', 'He has an Excel spreadsheet on his computer, with the names and contact infor-\n', 'mation of over 1,400 volunteers around the world, working to save endangered \n', 'species.\n', '“When I scroll through it, it feels amazing, I can’t quite describe it,” he says. \n', '“Seeing all of the volunteers conducting these amazing projects is definitely what \n', 'drives me forward.”\n', 'When Elliot finishes high school in November, he is planning to take the Hu-\n', 'man Nature Projects to the next level. He has been dreaming of going into wildlife \n', 'filming for a long time. Together with an international wildlife movie production \n', 'company, he and his organization are planning to set up a website where 200 \n', 'volunteers from around the world will produce a 24-hour live stream of wildlife in \n', 'their home countries.

In the evenings, she enjoys learning about new \n', 'advances in scientific communities around the world. They give her inspiration \n', '- and plant seeds for her ideas. Gitanjali has a knack for developing inventions of \n', 'one kind or another. “Many of my inventions have been inspired by just watching \n', 'the news.”\n', 'Over time, she noticed disheartening stories running each day on climate \n', 'change. She started thinking deeply about all the different crises that her country \n', 'was facing. Thanks to her good education in STEM—Science, Technology, Engi-\n', 'neering and Math - she had a strong scientific base. She wondered what could she \n', 'do - with her affinity for tinkering, and the joy she gets from problem solving—to \n', 'help people who are suffering.\n', 'Gitanjali’s first venture was a response to the public health water crisis in \n', 'Flint, Michigan. “When I saw the TV broadcast from Flint, I was appalled. I \n', 'couldn’t believe how many kids my age were drinking lead poison everyday. And \n', 'this causes lifelong health problems. It was just so unfair. And no one was doing \n', 'anything about it.” The inadequate re- routing of the public water system resulted \n', 'in highly toxic levels of lead in the water supply. Hundreds of thousands of people \n', 'in the region were being affected since 2015. “The worst part is that by the time \n', 'people realize a problem like this, one that oftentimes can’t be physically seen, it’s \n', 'almost too late. They already have consumed it, and will suffer the negative effects \n', 'for the rest of their lives.”\n', '285\n', 'At age13, Gitanjali created Tethys to detect lead contamination in drinking \n', 'water sources. With this invention, people can assess—in real time—if their drink-\n', 'ing water has safe levels or not. The implications for places like Flint are enormous. \n', 'Gitanjali’s Tethys gained the attention of many national outlets - including by 3M, \n', 'which awarded her a $25,000 prize for winning their Young Scientist Challenge in \n', '2017. Now she is looking to partner with an incubator to raise funds and expand \n', 'the reach and breadth of chemicals she can test for. “Finding partners to expand \n', 'this idea is going to help me evolve into being an entrepreneur, not just an inventor. \n', 'As an entrepreneur, hopefully I can reach a lot more people.”\n', 'Another national health crisis Gitanjali learned a lot about on the news was \n', 'the opioid epidemic. Over the last decade, the opioid crisis has wreaked havoc on \n', 'communities in the United States. Since 2016, roughly 45,000 people a year have \n', 'been killed by opioids, mainly by overdose – and what’s especially tragic is that \n', 'roughly 2,100 of these overdoses a year occur in youth ages 15-24. Aside from \n', 'overdoses, there are many negative health-related consequences from the misuse \n', 'of opioids. Prescription opioids—from sports injuries - make up the majority of \n', 'health emergencies nationally. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n', 'estimate that for every overdose a youth has related to opioids, there are 119 emer-\n', 'gency room visits and 22 treatment admissions. In October of 2017, the opioid \n', 'epidemic became so impactful, that it was declared a public health emergency.\n', 'Gitanjali knew she wanted to do something about the opioid epidemic, even \n', 'though it on the opposite side of the scientific spectrum from her first invention. \n', '“I knew it wouldn’t be easy. But I like to solve problems affecting those in my age \n', 'group. I can relate more closely to problems that way.” And so she began working \n', 'out a biological solution to help with the prescription opioid addiction impacting \n', 'youth everywhere. And so she created Epione.\n', 'Epione is an app connected to a testing device, that detects how addicted \n', 'someone is or isn’t to opioids. The test detects the protein produced by a specific \n', 'gene when it comes into contact with prescription opioids. So the higher the pro-\n', 'tein level, the higher the indication is for opiates. “It’s sort of like a litmus test for \n', 'ph. An easy to read color strip shows on the app, and you can see where a person \n', 'is on the spectrum of addiction. The app also has corresponding maps to local \n', 'counselors, physicians, doctors, and others where youth can get help.” For this \n', 'invention, she won the TCS Ignite Innovation Student Challenge.\n', 'Gitanjali was horrified to see how many young people her age were strug-\n', 'gling with was bullying. Bullying—physical, verbal, and social. Direct, or passive. \n', 'In person and online. As a technically minded student, she began focusing on a \n', ' 286\n', 'way to help prevent a modern form of bullying that has been on the rise in recent \n', 'years – cyberbullying.\n', 'It’s estimated that around 5 million students a year are bullied, either in \n', 'person or online. This has serious mental health consequences for both the bully \n', 'and the victim. From higher rates of anxiety, suicide, depression, substance use, as \n', 'well as declining academic achievement. According to the HHS, over 60 percent \n', 'of youth who experience cyberbullying are significantly challenged to learn and \n', 'feel safe at school.\n', 'To help combat this epidemic, Gitanjali designed the app Kindly. Kindly \n', 'is an extension that can be added on to web browsers, social media sites, and \n', 'other mobile and desktop applications, that helps parents, educators, and students \n', 'alike detect potential bullying incidents – and stop them before they happen. It \n', 'highlights text that may be problematic, and blocks it, or allows it to be sent with \n', 'adjustments, depending on the severity of the language. In the near future, Gi-\n', 'tanjali hopes schools will adopt her app, and act as the first line of defense for \n', 'protecting victims of bullying.\n', 'For the youth who want to explore a similar path to Gitanjali, she has a few \n', 'words of wisdom surrounding fun, community, togetherness, and the hands-on \n', 'nature of a practical STEM education. “Whatever you are trying to learn, have \n', 'fun with it. Create communities to support your ideas. Learning happens most \n', 'productively when people can learn together. Don’t be afraid to make it hands-on. \n', 'Lectures have their place. But hands-on learning skills with real world experts is \n', 'the quickest way to becoming proficient. This sort of STEM training needs to be \n', 'in all of our classrooms.”\n', 'Gitanjali believes that the support of adults is critical for those youths pur-\n', 'suing their educational goals. “If we’re talking about parents, support whatever \n', 'your child wants to learn. If you are a teacher, do the same for your students. \n', 'We’ve all got a dream in mind, and it’s hard to follow that dream when you don’t \n', 'have support. I couldn’t imagine approaching such complex problems without \n', 'that support structure.”\n', 'Gitanjali also recommends that parents learn with their kids, and even try to \n', 'learn new things themselves as inspiration. Her advice is the same to adults who \n', 'approach learning themselves, “Have fun with it. There’s never a limit to fun. I \n', 'like to say, Go after it like a teenager!”\n', 'As a youth leader in STEM, who is vocal about advancing female involve-\n', 'ment and leadership in tech, Gitanjali has a message to women and girls. “I had \n', 'a mentor say to me, ‘Don’t go into it thinking you’re a girl or woman in tech.’ \n', '287\n', 'You are going after big ideas. You are solving incredibly complicated problems. \n', 'You are creating and inventing things. No matter who you are, these things are \n', 'commendable. So don’t qualify what you are and aren’t. Just break the stereotypes \n', 'that exist by being the best you can be. And do it while you are doing what you \n', 'love, and what you want to do. Don’t ever stop doing that.”\n', 'Gitanjali’s work has shown that traditional ideas of what STEM is and \n', 'isn’t, are outdated. Knowledge in STEM can lead to incredible advancements \n', 'in a society, beyond our institutions. Tethys, Epione, and Kindly are inventions \n', 'in what are seemingly three very different spaces. But in reality, each of these \n', 'technical creations play an important role in alleviating a specific contemporary \n', 'public health issue that is harming people on a day to day basis.

I didn’t know what the future held, but I sensed how histor-\n', 'ic this moment was. And I knew I was going to be a part of that future somehow.”\n', '293\n', 'Nainoa had grown up on a dairy farm in Niu Valley on the island of Oahu \n', 'when it was still an agricultural community. Here, Nainoa’s first teachers were \n', 'close to the land—and close to home. “My mother was a great inspiration for \n', 'me. She would always make us go out into the bush, and encouraged us to spend \n', 'our days in nature. She had the spirit of all the great naturalists, and it rubbed off \n', 'on me.” Another teacher that guided Nainoa was Yoshi Kawano, a family friend \n', 'and worker who lived on the dairy farm. “Yoshi was my great teacher about the \n', 'ocean,” Nainoa says. “One day he gave me a four-foot bamboo fishing pole and \n', 'took me to Maunalua Bay. With this gift, I found a place of wonderment where \n', 'I could really be at peace with myself.

Climate \n', 'change wasn’t taught. We were really unprepared to deal with these issues in every \n', 'way.” Nainoa also struggled with his Hawaiian identity, since that wasn’t taught \n', 'in schools either. “I realized that people don’t care to protect something they have \n', 'no connection to,” he says. “And so I realized why our Hawaiian identity and \n', 'heritage, which is so deeply connected to this place, was being ignored. Reviving \n', 'one’s understanding would inevitably awaken both. I realized that as a culture \n', 'going forward, we needed a new kind of teaching so that the next generation of \n', 'Hawaiians would be better prepared than we were.”\n', 'In the early 1970s, Nainoa found exactly the community of educators he \n', 'was looking for with the Polynesian Voyaging Society (PVS).

A government mandate to teach the Hawaiian language has had a pro-\n', 'found impact on this island nation. “Before the Hōkūle’a, there were less than \n', '100 native speakers left on the islands,” Nainoa says. “Now there are more than \n', '22,000 native Hawaiian speakers.”\n', '“The PVS and Hōkūle’a has given us hope. It’s showed us that we need to \n', 'change our relationship to the earth, and we need to educate ourselves about \n', 'how to get back to more sustainable ways. And it’s shown that in navigating by \n', 'our shared values and navigating by the power of community, we can change \n', 'anything. To put it simply, our relationship with Hawaii was renewed.”\n', 'Nainoa has since devoted his life to reviving ancient Hawaiian traditions \n', 'that were nearly lost. Whether he is working on cultural preservation, environ-\n', 'mental advocacy, or championing sustainable education for Hawaiian youth, he \n', 'credits everything he’s achieved to the guidance of generous teachers. “I’m not \n', 'a particularly smart or courageous person. If you read a headline about some of \n', 'the things I’ve done, you might think that,” he says. “But you’d be wrong. I owe \n', 'everything I’ve done to the great teachers I’ve been fortunate to learn from in my \n', 'journey of life.”\n', 'Nainoa has been involved with all of the Hōkūle’a’s voyages after the initial \n', 'one, and has remained a central navigator for the PVS since the early 1970s. \n', 'Over a period of 45 years, his voyages have totaled more than 250,000 nautical \n', 'miles—the equivalent of circumnavigating the earth 20 times. From 2014-2017, \n', 'the Worldwide Voyage covered 41,000 miles, visited 322 ports, and heard stories \n', 'from concerned communities all over the world who are suffering from climate \n', 'change. “It’s clear that if we don’t do anything to combat climate change, there’s \n', 'going to be a lot of suffering,” Nainoa says. But he adds that there’s reason for \n', 'hope. “We met extraordinary people doing work in environmental and cultural \n', 'spaces. We learned from hundreds of Indigenous communities that have been \n', 'sustained for thousands of years with the common understanding that Mother \n', 'Earth will take care of it all, if we take care of her.”\n', '295\n', 'Nainoa is now planning the launch of the Moananuiākea Voyage in 2022. \n', '“We are planning to circumnavigate the Pacific, since the engine of environment is \n', 'the Pacific. It regulates climate, food sovereignty, distribution of temperature—all \n', 'of the most important issues of sustainability for the 21st century.” For this bound-\n', 'ary-breaking voyage, Nainoa has advocated for youth involvement at all levels of \n', 'the process. “We’re mandating that at least a third of the 300-person crew has to \n', 'be under the age of 25, so that these skills are passed on to the next generation.”\n', 'Nainoa is hopeful about the future. “Within weeks of asking for youth volun-\n', 'teers for the Moananuiākea Voyage, we had to start turning people away—which \n', 'is a good thing.

Growing up in the vibrant city of Quito, Ecuador, she was surrounded by \n', 'marvels of nature on all sides. Ecuador is home to many rare and unique natural \n', 'environments. This country on the equator contains everything from misty cloud \n', 'forests to glowing, active volcanoes dotting the horizon.\n', 'Ecuador has the distinction of having the planet’s greatest biodiversity per \n', 'hectare. Among the rare animals found there is the spectacled bear, which exists \n', 'only in a narrow ribbon of land in South America. There are also the many \n', 'endangered species of the Galapagos Islands, such as the giant tortoise. Ecuador \n', 'is also home to the world’s largest flying bird, the Andean condor. All of these \n', 'unique species drove Daniela to want to understand how to protect and preserve \n', 'them and their environments, whether they be in the forests, grasslands, or the \n', 'ocean.\n', '“When I was young, my family used to take long trips from the city to the \n', 'coastline. Growing up surrounded by nature really molded my life and my ap-\n', 'preciation of the environment. I found that being around pristine nature in such \n', 'a beautiful place is really necessary for happiness. I always had an innate feeling, \n', 'even from the time I was very young, that these natural wonders had to be pre-\n', 'served.”\n', 'When she was 7 years old, Daniela moved with her mother to Chicago, to an \n', 'urban environment that couldn’t have been more different from where she lived \n', 'in Ecuador. “Landing in Chicago and looking out my window, it was flat land all \n', 'around. As a kid, not seeing any mountains or nature around scared me. It made \n', 'me appreciate what I had back home.”\n', 'At age 12, she had a wake-up call. Walking home from school one day, she \n', 'passed a shop window and saw something that would change her life. “I remem-\n', 'ber looking at this movie poster that had a penguin walking on sand – it turned \n', 'out to be An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore’s documentary on climate change. So, I \n', 'ran to the Blockbuster, because my favorite animal was a penguin and I wanted \n', 'to understand why it was walking on sand. I got the movie, I was so excited... and \n', 'the next thing you know, I’m in tears, learning about what could happen to our \n', 'environment and to the penguins that I adore, the animals I love, and our entire \n', 'climate. It was a catastrophe. But it opened my eyes to the reality.”\n', 'After that Daniela dedicated her life to protecting our environment. She \n', 'talked awareness, took environmental classes, and raised money to get solar panels \n', 'for her high school. She even got involved with the debate team, with aspirations \n', 'of running for office so she could influence environmental policy. And she en-\n', 'rolled at Georgetown University, which has strong connections with Washington’s \n', '297\n', 'environmental political leaders.\n', 'As a freshman there, she had another life-changing experience when was \n', 'invited to a meeting at the United Nations on the state of our oceans. “I was well \n', 'versed in climate change, but this was the first time I’d heard any discussion about \n', 'the role the ocean plays in the larger climate ecosystem. And I quickly realized I \n', 'was the only young person in the room, learning about what’s happening to our \n', 'oceans. I also noticed a few things that the older people wouldn’t. One was that \n', 'there were not many communication channels. There was no livestream. And no \n', 'social media getting this information out to my generation. I also realized that \n', 'everybody was talking about problems, sharing these doomsday statistics; but no \n', 'one was talking about solutions. No one had any hope about the innovations \n', 'that could move things forward. I left that meeting feeling completely devastated \n', 'because I had learned that our ocean was dying. And I also felt a sense of urgency \n', 'to let the world know, to let my own generation know, that this was something that \n', 'we had to pay attention to, because no one was talking about it.”\n', 'On the train ride back to Washington after the meeting in New York, Danie-\n', 'la had a eureka moment. She realized that she could do a lot more as an entrepre-\n', 'neur than as a policymaker. With this thought in mind, she picked up a pen and \n', 'pad. “I just started sketching out this model. It was literally two bubbles. In one \n', 'bubble I wrote ‘young people.’ In the other bubble, I put the names of influential \n', 'people, like various businessmen and high-level politicians. Then I put a concen-\n', 'tric circle in the middle and thought, this is what the Sustainable Ocean Alliance \n', '(SOA) needs to be. A platform where young people can interact with high-level \n', 'leaders so they can learn from them. But on the flip side, young people can also \n', 'contribute to the solutions that these high-level people are looking for, that they’re \n', 'not finding. That’s how the SOA was born.”\n', 'Back at Georgetown, she hosted the first ever Sustainable Ocean Summit, \n', 'and 500 students from across the country attended. Daniela incorporated her \n', 'forward-looking ideas into the agenda for the meeting, with the help of U.S. Sec-\n', 'retary of State John Kerry and the U.S. State Department. The meeting was \n', 'streamed to all the U.S. embassies around the world: some even had Embassy \n', 'watch parties, so young people from other countries could be involved.\n', '“This was the catalyst that really kicked SOA into high gear. After that meet-\n', 'ing, I had countless students from around the country asking me, How can I bring \n', 'this back to my own university, country, city? So, I built a toolkit to help others rep-\n', 'licate what I’d done. It made such an impact that after graduation, Georgetown \n', 'gave me a two-month stipend to raise the funds to create this nonprofit.”\n', ' 298\n', 'Daniela quickly became one of the leading youth activists in the sustainable \n', 'oceans space. She moved her headquarters to San Francisco, for proximity to an \n', 'innovative startup culture, and started building out various aspects of her orga-\n', 'nization.\n', '“There’s a lot of innovation here,” she says. “Our Ocean Leadership pro-\n', 'gram provides resources and mentorship for young, aspiring leaders to build hubs \n', 'in their regions.

Both young men were working in coffee shops to pay for school. After \n', 'making thousands of coffees—and throwing out filter after filter of spent grounds \n', 'at the end of their shifts—they had both started to realize something. It wasn’t just \n', 'one “aha! moment,” in particular, but many smaller ones over time. They realized \n', 'that coffee grounds, like cups and straws, represented a major source of waste that \n', 'the industry hadn’t really taken into consideration. Each year, in the tiny country \n', 'of Scotland alone, between 40,000 and 50,000 tons of coffee grounds are thrown \n', 'away. Across the UK, it’s half a million. Worldwide, that number is exponentially \n', 'higher.\n', 'Most of the coffee grounds in the world end up in massive, smelly landfills, \n', 'where they emit methane—a major greenhouse gas that is contributing to nearly \n', 'half of global warming.

Overwhelmed with the scale of the issue, they began with \n', 'some online research. They discovered many ways that used coffee grounds could \n', 'be reused and recycled: as fertilizer or compost, as a natural face scrub, even as \n', 'insect repellent. Someone just needed to figure out an effective and business-savvy \n', '301\n', 'way to turn this waste product into something useful. As thrifty Scotsmen, the \n', 'idea was compelling.

The coffee culture \n', 'is thriving, but that comes with an unfortunate byproduct: massive amounts of \n', 'waste. “The initial shock was just the volume of waste,” Fergus says. “When you \n', 'go into Starbucks and get your cappuccino, you don’t see the waste. Even if you \n', 'do see it, it just seems like such a small, little puck of waste, you don’t really think \n', 'about how much that all adds up when you take the millions and billions of people \n', 'drinking coffee every single day.”\n', '“You hear about carbon emissions, but once you actually start looking into \n', 'the numbers, it’s difficult to comprehend: the number of hectares of forest being \n', 'chopped, the number of tons of coffee waste, the number of tons of palm oil, the \n', 'number of carbon emissions. It’s really hard to even fathom,” Fergus says.\n', 'Fergus and Scott are leading the way to a better world, and so is their coun-\n', 'try.

She’d helped him to see that no matter how small a step might \n', 'seem, the tiniest effort can eventually make a huge difference. He was just a young \n', 'boy in school, but he had paid attention when she said that it didn’t matter how \n', 'old someone was; what mattered was the action they took to move the world into \n', 'the right direction.\n', 'So Sainath decided to start where he would be able to make a change—in \n', 'his own school. He’d seen that a lot of his classmates in the United Arab Emirates \n', '(UAE) used single-use plastics in their everyday lives. He found this extremely \n', 'concerning.\n', 'He’d first noticed the impact of single-use plastics when he had visited his \n', 'family’s hometown in India when he was 8 years old. “It’s normal for people in \n', 'India to use single-use plastics, like straws, cups, and plastic bags in their day-to-\n', 'day lives,” he remembers. “But there just isn’t enough room to dump all of the \n', 'waste. There were small pieces of plastic everywhere.” So the plastic ends up \n', 'being tossed in the streets and then ends up in the rivers and lakes.\n', 'Sainath was bothered enough by this that when he got home he did some \n', 'research. “This is a problem all over the world,” he says. “An estimated amount \n', 'of eight million tons of plastic ends up in the world’s oceans every year.” If that \n', 'continues, it is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than \n', 'there is marine wildlife. These shocking numbers made Sainath wonder what he \n', 'could do about it.\n', 'To start, Sainath created a campaign to collect plastic trash and old elec-\n', 'tronics from his classmates. Once every three months he would hand over all the \n', 'trash he had collected to the Emirates Environmental Group for recycling. “At \n', 'first, it wasn’t such a big deal,” he says. It was a just a project he had started with \n', ' 304\n', 'some friends, placing some trash cans in the school to collect plastic waste, and \n', 'convincing other students to stop using single-use plastics.\n', 'Then one day one of the teachers overheard Sainath talking to his friends \n', 'about the project. That’s when his PEPC (Papers, E-waste, Plastics, and Cans) \n', 'campaign moved to the next level. “She wanted me to give presentations about \n', 'our project to students in other classes,” Sainath says. “Soon more people realized \n', 'that they needed to get involved.”\n', 'It took some time, but eventually, as more students joined the effort, the \n', 'scope of the project grew. Together they started collecting plastic trash outside, \n', 'educating others about the importance of sustainability, and even planting plants \n', 'and trees around their school. Some students started bringing waste from home \n', 'that wouldn’t have been recycled otherwise.\n', '“It was really inspiring, and it gave me the energy I needed to move forward,” \n', 'Sainath says. He realized that what was happening was exactly what he’d learned \n', 'from the story about Jane Goodall: it just took one person to take one small step \n', 'in the right direction to create a much larger wave of change.\n', 'Around this time Sainath joined other young changemakers by becoming \n', 'a member of Jane Goodall’s Roots & Shoots Programme in the Emirates. “It’s \n', 'about raising awareness, reaching others, and taking small steps that will create a \n', 'big difference in the future,” he says.\n', 'By now he realized that it wasn’t going to be enough to tackle the issue of \n', 'plastic pollution by just collecting trash before it gets to the oceans. After all, there \n', 'is already an astonishing amount of plastic there. So he started to think about how \n', 'the plastic already in the ocean could be collected.\n', 'Because the United Arab Emirates has both desert and coastline, it is a \n', 'country with a strong interest in fighting environmental pollution and climate \n', 'change. Therefore, technology is often used there to tackle important problems, \n', 'like the lack of water for agriculture.\n', 'Sainath started thinking about how there might be a technical solution to \n', 'the problem of marine plastic pollution. He had started going to robotics classes \n', 'when he was 9 years old. Now he started wondering if his knowledge of robotics \n', 'might be used to address this problem.\n', 'He decided to apply what he’d learned about robotics and put his skills to \n', 'work.

There \n', 'were many technical problems to solve: how to make the robot float, how to col-\n', '305\n', 'lect the plastic from the water, where to store the collected plastic, and how to \n', 'protect the robot’s sensitive electronics from the water.\n', '“I used recyclable materials, like plastic bottles, popsicle sticks, pencils, and \n', 'sheet glass to make my robot float on the surface of the water,” he explains. His \n', 'robot—which he calls Marine Robot Cleaner (M-Bot for short)—has three little \n', 'motors: two of them act as paddles, and a third motor in the front is used to push \n', 'the plastic trash into a basket attached to the robot’s back.\n', 'With his robot Sainath aims to protect marine habitats and work toward the \n', 'UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water.

The batteries can then be charged with solar panels, making \n', 'the robot completely carbon neutral. A Global Positioning System (GPS) can be \n', 'installed in the robot for navigational purposes, and a rotatable wireless camera \n', 'and sensor can be fitted.

He’d been a risk-taker who had pursued his own romantic version of the \n', 'American dream. After a major earthquake in Tokyo, he left everyone and every-\n', 'thing in Japan to join his uncle on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. There he would \n', 'find work in the sugarcane fields. The work was hard and the days were hot. But \n', 'as tough as the work was, the land provided, as it does for those who respect it. \n', 'Soon, he’d realize his dream of owning and operating his own business.\n', 'Vincent’s father had a similar drive to see the world. And so he moved the \n', 'family back to Asia for a new life and a better path. Growing up, Vincent experi-\n', 'enced the worlds of Hong Kong, Beijing, and Malaysia, and learned to appreciate \n', 'the beauty of each. But wherever he was, he always remembered his grandfather’s \n', '307\n', 'stories of working in the sugarcane fields. He felt a pull toward the tradition of \n', 'working the land. And so he decided early on in life that he was going to pursue \n', 'his own daring dream. He was going to go against the cultural tide of fast money. \n', 'He wanted to heal the broken patterns that the world–especially the world of \n', 'agriculture–had fallen into. He decided to dedicate his life to protecting the envi-\n', 'ronment, and the small farmers who’ve always known how to care for it.\n', 'Vincent made the necessary sacrifices, and moved to the mainland Unit-\n', 'ed States. He wanted to learn everything he could, so his first step was to earn \n', 'his bachelor’s degree in environmental science at Oregon State University. After \n', 'graduation, he worked first at the Pacific Basin Economic Council, then at the \n', 'accounting firm KPMG, and finally at the Institute for Triple Helix Innovation, \n', 'where he was able to see how academia, industry, and government can work to-\n', 'gether for social and economic advancement. He studied innovative approaches \n', 'to sustainability around the world. Gradually, with guidance from his mentors \n', 'Bernice Glenn and Robert Lees, Vincent was ready to make his mark in the world \n', 'of sustainable farming.\n', 'Since then, over the years he has built multiple green businesses to help \n', 'small farmers. Inovi Green develops alternatives to toxic indoor cleaning products. \n', 'AgriGro’s line of green products adds beneficial microbes to the agricultural cycle. \n', 'And his most impactful venture, Smart Yields (SY), gives farmers access to up-to-\n', 'date data on their land through the use of a mobile app that provides real-time \n', 'monitoring and analytics of their crops. With this powerful information, small \n', 'and mid- sized farmers can plan ahead and achieve a greater degree of precision \n', 'in their agricultural practices. This high level of precision means less waste, lower \n', 'costs, and a more sustainable cycle.\n', 'But as a data man, Vincent knows just how unsustainable our current ag-\n', 'ricultural systems are. “Small farmers are struggling,” he says, quoting the most \n', 'recent USDA data. “Since 1997, we’ve lost nearly 200,000 farms, over 50 million \n', 'acres of land. And 100,000 of those farms have been lost in just the last seven \n', 'years.” Vincent is especially concerned that the number of family-owned farms \n', 'has fallen by 170,000, while corporation-owned farms have increased by 26,000.\n', 'Vincent listens to farmers share their concerns; and they believe this rapid \n', 'change should be seen as a warning. More big agribusiness adds up to increased fi-\n', 'nancial pressures on small farmers. When farmers are struggling to survive against \n', 'the power of agribusiness, it affects whole communities. Prices drop. The “little \n', 'guy” can’t compete. Corporations don’t need to buy local, so they don’t. Money \n', 'generated from the land doesn’t stay in the community. Local shops are no longer \n', ' 308\n', 'supported, so they suffer too.\n', 'A small farmer struggling is a sign of an unsustainable community. Small \n', 'farmers, who are on the front line of climate change, are just not prepared to face \n', 'its threats. A system with less diversity. Fewer viewpoints. Lost traditional, local \n', 'knowledge. And this unsustainable cycle is repeating itself in small rural farming \n', 'towns across the United States. It is a serious threat to our country’s food security.\n', 'Vincent is committed to helping repair this endangered cycle all over the \n', 'world. Thanks to SY, small farmers now have access to the same technology as big \n', 'corporations, at their fingertips. This makes for healthier, more competitive, and \n', 'more productive farms.\n', 'Vincent first tested SY’s advanced technology in Colorado in 2017. Steve \n', 'Ela is a fourth-generation family farmer there who has 80 acres of orchards. SY’s \n', 'app allows him to micromanage his fruit trees, which is critical, especially when \n', 'unpredictable bouts of freezing weather hit. “Climate change is going to shake up \n', 'what we know as normal,” says Steve. “Every year adds another data point.” But, \n', 'he adds, there is strength in numbers; when all farmers in the community pool \n', 'their data, their region is stronger.\n', 'Edward Tufts, another Colorado farmer, has a 500-acre organic orchard in \n', 'the Rocky Mountains. Thanks to SY, his business, Leroux Creek Foods, was able \n', 'to save a crop of Honeycrisp apples during a late frost. “It can cost $500 an acre to \n', 'heat an orchard through the frost season” he explains. “This system, which I can \n', 'easily monitor on my phone, reduces my expenses by allowing me to operate more \n', 'efficiently.” For Edward, this savings was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n', 'But the impact of SY goes far beyond dollars and cents. It makes the farm-\n', 'ing cycle more sustainable every step of the way. This technology has made such a \n', 'positive impact in the world of sustainability that it was accepted in the first round \n', 'of the Vatican’s inaugural accelerator program, called the Laudato Si’ Challenge. \n', '“When the Vatican officially recognized that climate change is real, it sent a uni-\n', 'fying message around the globe,” Vincent says. “As business leaders, we can’t put \n', 'profit first. We have to respond with what’s best for future generations. This is the \n', 'way Indigenous peoples lived...I’ve really redefined my perspective as a CEO. The \n', 'journey isn’t about the next billion dollars. There are larger things at play.”\n', 'What Vincent really likes to talk about is bridge-building through mentor-\n', 'ship, education, and professional development training. “I’ve always been a prob-\n', 'lem solver,” he says. “It is part of my personality. I’m always looking for better, \n', 'faster, more efficient ways of doing things. And that goes for mentorship, which \n', 'has been core to my ethos. So I ask myself, what are we not taught about when we \n', '309\n', 'are embarking on an entrepreneurial journey?”\n', 'Some of the most valuable lessons Vincent learned along his own journey \n', 'he learned by getting involved with local civic groups. “Right out of college, I \n', 'went into Rotary Youth Leadership training. There, I learned how to manage \n', 'insecurities and ego. Every journey can be fraught with mental health challenges. \n', 'Burnout. Depression. Countless other things. Entrepreneurs need to understand \n', 'this early on. When they see the signs of these things, they should take a step back,” \n', 'he says. “We need to be taught about these things to be able to recognize them.”\n', 'Vincent has found that this wisdom is rare in the world of farming. “Nowa-\n', 'days, farmers are really struggling with mental health issues,” he says. Increased \n', 'pressures—very long days, unpredictable weather, delinquent loans, rising debts, \n', 'bankruptcies—has farmers fearing they will lose everything, including their fam-\n', 'ily’s hard-earned legacy. Suicides are at the highest level in decades. “We need to \n', 'change our perspective and talk about these things without judgment,” Vincent \n', 'says. “No matter where you are, you aren’t alone. There’s a tribe of people out \n', 'there who can support you.” Vincent finds that getting his hands in the soil is the \n', 'best therapy. Growing vegetables is being used to treat PTSD in veterans, and \n', 'others. “Once someone feels that connection to the earth, there’s a pathway to \n', 'healing,” he says.\n', 'Vincent believes that if we act quickly, with some structural changes we can \n', 'reestablish a healthy, sustainable approach to agriculture–and to our whole way \n', 'of life. There are models to learn from all over the world, he says, and mentions \n', 'innovative field design in the Netherlands as an example. Then he adds, “In Ha-\n', 'waii we can learn from our native systems. Years ago Hawaii fed over a million \n', 'people from local, sustainable farms: now, we import 85-90 percent of our food. \n', 'We need to support people in renewing our farms.

It \n', 'was July 2010, and a looming energy crisis was taking hold of the world. Her driv-\n', 'er was waiting in a long line of cars at a filling station, hoping to refuel before the \n', 'pumps ran out. Which wasn’t guaranteed– nothing was during the crisis. There \n', 'was a massive shortage in oil supply, and this sort of wait had become normal.\n', 'As she waited, exhaust came through the windows, polluting the air she \n', 'breathed. It clouded the atmosphere around the lines of cars as well. Everything \n', 'felt cramped and suffocating. The streets were polluted. The expressions on wor-\n', 'ried faces all around her were difficult to take in. As Azza looked around at the \n', 'seemingly hopeless scene, a thought struck her: Why are we so dependent on oil?\n', 'There had been peaks and valleys in the price of oil before. But this time \n', 'it was particularly harmful. In the year from July 2007 to July 2008, the price of \n', 'crude oil had risen from $60 a barrel to nearly $140. This impacted all sectors \n', 'of the economy, and wreaked havoc in the daily lives of countless people around \n', 'the world.\n', 'Many factors were contributing to this situation. Climate change. Political \n', 'hostilities in the Middle East. Dwindling oil reserves. An increase in global de-\n', '311\n', 'mand for oil from developing regions. Financial speculation.\n', 'But as complicated as these reasons may be, the reality for the average per-\n', 'son was quite simple: a crushing increase in the price of oil. And since oil is so \n', 'entangled in global markets, an oil shortage makes the prices of many other goods \n', 'and services rise dramatically as well.\n', 'This obviously affects lower income people disproportionately. The price \n', 'of heating oil skyrockets. People have to make this-or-that choices at the market. \n', 'Stress levels go off the charts. And of course, there is that one hallmark of any \n', 'supply issue surrounding oil: long lines at every filling station in sight.\n', 'But sometimes, out of chaos can come clarity. And in a somewhat ironic \n', 'twist of fate, it was in one of those frustrating filling station lines that Azza’s jour-\n', 'ney as a youth leader in alternative energy began.\n', '“After that day, I often thought about how to approach our dependency prob-\n', 'lem,” she says. Then one day at 14, she had a moment of revelation on another \n', 'car trip, from Alexandria to Cairo.\n', '“As we were driving, I saw this huge landfill. We passed by it slowly. It was \n', 'so big I thought it was never going to end. At that point I thought, there’s just so \n', 'much raw material here. What if somehow we could use all this waste to solve the \n', 'energy crisis?”\n', 'It all started moving really fast from there. Azza had a lot of questions. And \n', 'so, with the support of her family, who are all very scientifically minded, she dove \n', 'deeper into learning about plastic waste. “That’s the second biggest category of \n', 'waste, behind paper waste,” she explains. “So there was no shortage of material \n', 'to work with. In time, I started studying how waste can be converted to fuel.” But \n', 'of course, as just a teenager, she was limited in her knowledge.\n', 'Luckily, at 15 years old, she was welcomed by the Petroleum Research Insti-\n', 'tute in Cairo, to work with two of their scientists, Dr. Tarek Fahmi and Dr. Mam-\n', 'douh El Melawy, on the project. “They were amazing mentors to me,” she says.\n', 'Azza and her team ended up utilizing an existing catalyst in a different pro-\n', 'cess that can break down plastic waste and turn it into fuel that can power vehicles. \n', 'Even more amazing, this catalyst is significantly cheaper than the catalysts that \n', 'were being commonly used prior to their discovery.\n', 'This discovery has huge implications on the climate change front and beyond. \n', 'Because the process is cheaper, more people will adopt it. Waste will be reduced in \n', 'more places, more quickly. This in turn will lead to communities having a reduced \n', 'dependency on oil. And, as with any discovery, new knowledge leads to additional \n', ' 312\n', 'advances and discoveries. And all of these component parts can produce jobs in a \n', 'variety of new sectors for local economies.\n', 'In 2012, Azza won the European Fusion Development Agreement award at \n', 'the European Union Contest for Young Scientists for her work.

So, I decided to study abroad. I applied to a university \n', 'in Canada, to study electrical or environmental engineering—-but I didn’t make \n', 'it. I didn’t get the required scores to qualify. That was a really devastating period \n', 'for me. I’d won these competitions. Received praise for my accomplishments.

Those who spoke a language others didn’t speak \n', 'would sing the chorus in their mother tongue.” One by one, the chorus was belted \n', 'out in French, German, Spanish, Yiddish, and a variety of African dialects- -a \n', 'rich diversity of accents, indigenous languages, in voices from around the world. \n', 'Everyone was encouraged to repeat the words back in their same language, which \n', 'created an exciting exchange of cultures. “In that moment, I really felt included,” \n', 'says Jonah. “I began to see the beauty in people who are different. But mainly, I \n', 'lost my fear, and that allowed for real human connection.”\n', 'When Jonah got back to high school, he made it a point to learn everyone’s \n', 'first and last name – particularly those students he thought might be feeling os-\n', 'tracized, much in the way he had felt before his camp experience. It was his first \n', 'foray into a personal type of activism, in the tried-and-true practice of Radical \n', 'Inclusion. Now, twenty years later, he’s still stewarding support for global youth \n', 'leaders.\n', 'In 2000 Jonah founded the Global Youth Action Network (GYAN) to con-\n', ' 320\n', 'nect, support, and empower youth globally. GYAN was formed with multiple \n', 'aims in mind: to increase youth participation in decision making; to facilitate \n', 'international collaboration of youth organizations; and to create a structure of \n', 'support from established leaders in social entrepreneurship. With the support he \n', 'has gotten from corporations, institutions, and governments, Jonah has helped to \n', 'amplify the voice of youth in the policy and decision-making processes in more \n', 'than 180 countries around the world. In 2001 GYAN merged with TakingIT-\n', 'Global, a network of several thousand youth NGOs whose online platform is \n', 'visited by thousands of people every day.\n', 'In 2011 Jonah went on to found NEXUS, a global network of influential \n', 'philanthropists and social entrepreneurs who are tackling a wide array of social \n', 'causes and issues, including disaster relief and humanitarian aid, especially in the \n', 'regions most affected by climate change.\n', 'For example, in August 2019, Hurricane Dorian tore through the Grand \n', 'Bahamas. A Category 5 hurricane with winds reaching 185 mph, Dorian caused \n', 'nearly $3.5 billion in damage to this island nation. Nearly 70,000 people were \n', 'left homeless in its wake, with nowhere to go, and local transportation and food \n', 'supplies were devastated. NEXUS quickly responded to Grand Bahama Port Au-\n', 'thority’s Director Rupert Hayward’s call for assistance; they reached out to their \n', 'network of philanthropists to provide a lifeline of supplies. In the end, NEXUS \n', 'members donated 19 planes, more than 50 boats, and nearly $2 million of aid for \n', 'relief efforts.\n', 'At the forefront of NEXUS’s climate-related work is their support for inno-\n', 'vation in the environmental and renewable energy spaces. NEXUS member Sam \n', 'Teicher’s organization Coral Vita is helping to rebuild damaged and vulnerable \n', 'coral reefs around the world. With 30 percent of the world’s coral reefs already \n', 'gone, and 75 percent of what remains forecast to be lost by 2050, organizations \n', 'like Coral Vita are needed now more than ever. Coral reefs are essential for main-\n', 'taining the ocean’s ecosystem. They provide a home for an astonishing 25 percent \n', 'of the biodiversity we see in marine life. They act as protective barriers for main-\n', 'land areas, by absorbing wave shocks. And when they are intact, they can serve as \n', 'lucrative destinations for ecotourism.\n', 'Using an innovative technique called micro-fragmenting, scientists at Coral \n', 'Vita have been able to create growth in coral restoration “farms” in a span of 6-12 \n', 'months, a process that would normally take 25-30 years in the ocean. While this \n', 'has incredible implications for reef recovery, it will still be an uphill battle. As the \n', 'farms grow, the scientists invite people to visit them, so they have an opportunity \n', '321\n', 'to teach the next generation of scientists and conservationists about the impor-\n', 'tance of innovation and social entrepreneurship.\n', 'Through the NEXUS Impact Accelerator program, Jonah is striving to get \n', 'resources directly to those social entrepreneurs who are working on the most crit-\n', 'ical global environmental challenges. An inaugural fellow in this program, Blayne \n', 'Ross, is CEO of Shorelock, a company working to protect vulnerable coastlines \n', 'around the world. Shorelock helps sandy beaches, shorelines, and coastlines resist \n', 'erosion by wave action, winds, storms, and other natural phenomena. By applying \n', 'a powdered mix of a sustainable bonding agent to sand, it creates a microlayer \n', 'of water that helps waves run off the shore without bringing the sand along with \n', 'them. This technology has been proven to be 100 percent environmentally sound, \n', 'and has even helped restore the breeding habitats for certain rare species like sea \n', 'turtles. Shorelock works with the Small Islands Resiliency Program in the Baha-\n', 'mas to protect the coastal lands of indigenous communities, while ensuring that \n', 'the vital islands’ infrastructures, which have been severely impacted by climate \n', 'change, remain intact.\n', 'Galvanizing support for innovation in combating plastics pollution is also \n', 'critical for Jonah. The SUpR Initiative, launched by NEXUS in 2020 in partner-\n', 'ship with Oceanic Global and Accenture, works with professional sports teams \n', 'to reduce and eliminate single use plastics in stadiums. Along with NEXUS \n', 'community-led summits like the Ocean SOS Tech Summit in 2018, Jonah has \n', 'organized the resources and knowledge to think creatively about ways to solve \n', 'plastic pollution in oceans.\n', 'He is also helping to raise the visibility of social entrepreneurs in the politi-\n', 'cal and financial arenas. In 2018, he founded the Healthy Democracy Coalition \n', '(HDC) to help mend the political divide in the United States, by bringing Repub-\n', 'licans and Democrats donors together to address the societal problems that have \n', 'been ignored, and exacerbated, as a result of the increasing divisiveness. Jonah \n', 'believes that by creating communities to seek solutions together to problem issues \n', 'like plastics pollution, environmental damage, or even the need for a green, global \n', 'currency, it will bring people closer, while accelerating the speed with which we \n', 'can solve these problems.\n', 'Jonah strongly believes that getting youth involved in decision making along \n', 'with adults offers a variety of benefits, especially at a time when people are so \n', 'divided. One reason why young people are such a key leverage point for any social \n', 'change strategy, he says, is because they can see the problems that aren’t being \n', 'addressed. They can see problem solvers who’ve gone stagnant, and become out \n', ' 322\n', 'of touch. Investing in young people becomes a positive investment in the future. \n', '“Until we fix the ways we are managing the global commons, there will continue to \n', 'be problems in the future,” Jonah says. “Until we can overcome the accountability \n', 'gap of our current global governance system, these problems will only get worse, \n', 'not better.

He was assigned to write a “puff piece” \n', 'on the Egyptian cotton industry, known as the finest, most luxurious cotton in \n', 'the world. At first, it seemed like an unimportant story – a page-filler that on the \n', 'surface seemed unlike the kind of political story he usually sought out. But as he \n', 'began his research, he learned about the harmful industrial agricultural practices \n', 'that were being used in the Egyptian cotton industry, and the devastating toll these \n', 'practices were having on the health of the farmers. This discovery changed the \n', 'trajectory of David’s professional life almost immediately.\n', 'It’s well known that the gas and oil industries are contributing to our current \n', 'environmental crisis, but with cotton, there is no apparent evidence of pollution—\n', 'no puffs of smoke coming from exhaust pipes that we can easily see or smell. And \n', 'yet, “75 percent of the farmers I spoke with had cancer from the incredibly toxic \n', 'pesticides being used,” says David. “As I dug into the story more, I discovered that \n', 'cotton was the second dirtiest industry in the world, right after oil and gas.”\n', '331\n', 'Cotton is a crop grown from the earth like any vegetable or fruit, and it \n', 'has all of the dangerous pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and other \n', 'chemicals used in the agricultural production process. But it is not simply harvest-\n', 'ed and then sent to stores to be consumed, like tomatoes or carrots. Cotton also \n', 'has a massive manufacturing footprint, processes during which dyes, solvents, and \n', 'all other kinds of chemical treatments are used, which can make it particularly \n', 'toxic. Some estimates state that the average T-shirt has more than 40 kinds of \n', 'chemicals that the FDA considers harmful – and these chemicals have been found \n', 'in alarming numbers in the breast-milk of new mothers around the world.\n', '“When I saw the toll this process was taking on human lives, and on the envi-\n', 'ronment; and that it was being ignored by everyone else in the region, I realized I \n', 'didn’t just want to report on this urgent story,” says David. “I really wanted to do \n', 'something about it. I wanted to make a change.”\n', 'To understand the scale of the cotton industry and its environmental impact, \n', 'in 2019, there were nearly 14 million acres of cotton fields planted in the U.S. \n', 'alone. This yields roughly 800 pounds per acre, all of which has been chemically \n', 'treated in the fields, and then will be treated again in the manufacturing process, \n', 'as it is worked into textiles. In Egypt, in 2019, there were roughly 350,000 bales of \n', 'cotton produced, each of which contains 480 pounds of cotton.\n', 'David’s first article about the cotton industry caused quite a stir. And the \n', 'more he wrote about it, the more entrepreneurs who had similar concerns about \n', 'the cotton industry reached out to him. Mostly, they reached out to thank him for \n', 'highlighting this issue. Frequently, they wanted to spread the word about business-\n', 'es in the fashion industry that were using ethically and environmentally conscious \n', 'practices.\n', 'For his next adventure, David decided to build a socially conscious company. \n', 'So he returned home to the U.S. and started his first company, Modavanti, an \n', 'online boutique for ethical fashion brands. “My Mom was happy I was coming \n', 'home, since the Middle East was dangerous,” David says. “However, when I told \n', 'her I was planning to start a fashion company, she was pretty confused. I’d never \n', 'been into fashion. And in the beginning, I really didn’t know anything about fash-\n', 'ion. In fact, I was known for my rumpled journalist look,” he says with a laugh.\n', 'To David, it didn’t matter what industry he worked in, or what people \n', 'thought about his new venture. What mattered to him was that he could create a \n', 'mission-driven company, one that would tell the story of entrepreneurs that are \n', 'running businesses the right way.\n', 'After receiving a massive amount of support from ethical fashion companies \n', ' 332\n', 'around the world, he was invited to speak at the United Nations about the need \n', 'for sustainable fashion. “Through this process, I really learned about the power \n', 'of community,” he says. “I learned that if you share your story, and you live with \n', 'passion and conviction, people will come along for the ride with you.”\n', 'For six years, David grew Modavanti; then he sold it because he wanted to \n', 'expand his social entrepreneurship ventures. “I, and so many others, feel the need \n', 'to push the boundaries and keep going,” he says. “We must never get complacent \n', 'with what we’ve accomplished. So many challenges lay ahead of us. With a strong \n', 'community, we can impact change in a positive way for everyone.” To explain \n', 'his unique business ventures, David likes to quote a favorite television character, \n', 'Sam Seaborn of The West Wing: “The history of man is hung on the timeline of \n', 'exploration, and this is what is next.”\n', 'At Modavanti, David had built partnerships with several brands that were \n', 'addressing the issues of plastic waste, recycling, and upcycling plastic from beach-\n', 'es and waterways. He realized that with a little bit of entrepreneurial know-how, \n', 'he could leverage this community for the next level of good. This is when David \n', 'decided to join Nexus, where a vast network of like-minded, socially conscious en-\n', 'trepreneurs were on the forefront of enacting precisely this type of approach. Da-\n', 'vid went on to lead the sustainable fashion segment at the Nexus Summit, where \n', 'he was embraced by the community, offered support in a variety of ways, and \n', 'was set up with mentorship opportunities from the veterans in the space. He was \n', 'encouraged to continue tackling larger and more nuanced sustainability issues by \n', 'this strong community he’d found, and he credits this support as having a great \n', 'impact on his continued success.\n', 'As Director of Impact Initiatives at Nexus, David, with the increasing sup-\n', 'port of the community, decided to take on one of the most pressing sustinability \n', 'issues of our time – plastic waste. So, in 2020 he launched his new venture, SUPR, \n', 'with the purpose of making an impact on the reduction of single-use plastic prod-\n', 'ucts. To realize his ambitious goal, SUPR partnered with Accenture and Oceanic \n', 'Global, to develop a master plan for how professional sports teams can transform \n', 'their supply chains to become plastic-free.\n', 'All of David’s ventures are done with a dual purpose: to introduce sustain-\n', 'ability concepts to a wider, and younger, audience. Since so many people around \n', 'the world are influenced by sports, David believes that if organizations like SUPR \n', 'can get cultural leaders to get vocal about social responsibility, it can go a long way \n', 'towards making a healthier, more sustainable world.\n', 'In 2020, the Miami Dolphins hosted the Superbowl for the first time in 10 \n', '333\n', 'years. David was thrilled that the Dolphins went 99.4 percent plastic free for the \n', 'Big Game, implementing many of SUPR’s plastic free solutions.\n', 'Since then five teams have made the pledge, and have committed to making \n', 'changes in their supply chains and practices to reduce plastics. One team has even \n', 'begun recycling Coke bottles and turning them into athletic wear for stadium \n', 'employees.\n', 'David knows that we are reliant on the next generation to come up with the \n', 'solutions to save the planet.\n', 'For youth who want to get involved with such work, he says, “It’s not going \n', 'to be easy. But nothing that’s worthwhile is: it’s important not be dissuaded by \n', 'the challenges that lay ahead of us. They are both wide and far-reaching.” He \n', 'wants young entrepreneurs to understand that creating a mission-driven business \n', 'isn’t going to harm their chances of success. “In the near future, businesses with \n', 'a social, environmental, or justice-related mission will be the ones leading the \n', 'way,” he says. “Saving the planet and helping others will be part and parcel of \n', 'successful businesses. And since we are at such a tipping point, I not only believe \n', 'it’s economically the correct move –I believe it is our obligation to do so.”\n', 'David knows from where he speaks.

Coming from a long line of philanthropists, this is something Sam \n', 'understands well.\n', '“My grandpa founded a multinational tech firm and accumulated a lot of \n', 'wealth. My dad followed in his footsteps. That created a childhood for me with \n', 'a lot of privilege. Every opportunity was available to us. I went to a great private \n', 'school in San Diego. I grew up in a beautiful home with a view of the ocean. It \n', 'was a picture-perfect childhood.”\n', 'Through his travels, Sam learned early on that he was privileged, and his \n', 'parents reminded him every step of the way. “I knew I had a privileged position \n', 'in the world. And because of that, I had a great responsibility too,” he explains. \n', '“That sort of wealth doesn’t come from nowhere. It’s only possible because of the \n', 'community.”\n', 'Sam’s grandparents were influential philanthropists, and their giving plant-\n', 'ed a similar seed in him. They supported all kinds of cultural institutions, muse-\n', 'ums, universities, and arts programs. And one Chanukah, they shifted the focus \n', 'of their giving to Sam.\n', '“When I was 18 my grandparents gave me some money to give to charities of \n', 'my choice,” Sam explains. “This is when I really started thinking seriously about \n', 'philanthropy. At first I was pretty overwhelmed. It was a lot of responsibility! \n', 'There were so many questions. Who deserves my help? What causes are worthy \n', 'of addressing? Mainly, I wondered, what were my values as a donor?”\n', 'At the same time, the Occupy Wall St. movement was unfolding. Sam’s En-\n', 'glish teacher, Mr. Hendrickson, was teaching a class called the Art of Protest. He \n', 'brought the class to downtown San Diego, where for the first time Sam could real-\n', '335\n', 'ly see the way people were feeling about – and suffering from – income inequality.\n', '“It really affected me,” says Sam. “It made me wonder what were the root \n', 'causes of this inequality. And how do we combat them?” Sam admits, “It took me \n', 'a long time to get a hold on that,” he says, adding, “I’d been shielded and protect-\n', 'ed. After a lot of deliberation, I realized something important. Despite my elite \n', 'education, I wasn’t actually in the best position to solve these problems. Actually, \n', 'the solution should come from the people who’d been dealt the short end of the \n', 'stick. That’s when I realized that what I really wanted to do was to take the money \n', 'I’d been given, and help lead people affected by economic inequality out of their \n', 'situation. And I also wanted to invest it, and allow those resources to build lasting \n', 'political power...So I decided to unite the wealthy, and towards a transformative \n', 'common goal: upending inequality.”\n', 'A few years later, Sam found the missing piece of this puzzle at Resource \n', 'Generation (RG). RG is a community of young people with wealth and/ or class \n', 'privilege who are committed to a more equitable distribution of wealth, land, and \n', 'power.\n', '“At RG I finally found people doing really powerful work in philanthropy,” \n', 'Sam says. “I met young people with wealth, in a similar situation to mine, which \n', 'helped me combat feelings of isolation. And we were fighting on important fronts. \n', 'This was important for me.”\n', 'Now Sam works with RG hosting workshops, learning exchanges, and meet-\n', 'ing groups where people can get together, and share feelings about their class and \n', 'wealth. “It’s important to have a shared space with mutual understanding,” Sam \n', 'says. “We nurture strong accountability relationships. It’s crucial to be open and \n', 'transparent with partners who don’t come from wealthy backgrounds too. Hon-\n', 'esty has to be key. We’re so often discouraged from talking about these things that \n', 'we get all twisted up inside about what wealth is for, and what it’s supposed to do.”\n', 'That’s why Sam signed the RG’s Giving Pledge.

He’s involved with a variety of \n', 'non-profit organizations that fight against disparities in social, economic, and \n', 'criminal justice. In the fight for housing justice, Sam has partnered with the New \n', 'York chapter of the Right to the City Alliance (RTTC).

In \n', 'April 2020 he will be guiding rallies in support of the Green New Deal, leading \n', 'acts of civil disobedience, and directing volunteers.\n', 'Sam has also been closely involved with the NBA (National Basketball As-\n', 'sociation).

So much we’re told about money is about safety, or \n', 'security. Or the ability to use your money to get into a good school, to get a good \n', '337\n', 'job, and to make more money. Everything is in the service of money – not the \n', 'community. That sort of story really covers up the fact that we are the most safe, \n', 'secure, and able to flourish, when we are in deep community, and interdependent \n', 'on each other.

Today, 17 years later, the majority of my work is in the \n', 'climate space.

Anderson, “The Greenest CEO in America,” often shared the story \n', 'of how he had his environmental epiphany. “What is Interface doing to help the \n', 'environment?” a customer had asked one of the company’s sales reps one day. \n', '“Complying with environmental law,” he had answered.\n', 'But when Ray was told about this exchange, although he knew it was an \n', 'accurate response, he realized it wasn’t actually a very good answer. He felt that \n', 'Interface could do better than that.\n', 'By that time, Interface was a multinational manufacturing powerhouse lead-\n', 'ing the modular carpeting industry. There was no real reason for Anderson to \n', 'risk his position at the top, and he hadn’t intended to—until that question from \n', 'a conscientious customer came to his attention, and caused him to think again.\n', 'Ray Anderson prided himself on being a thoughtful and intellectually curi-\n', 'ous man. He knew it was what had allowed him to have such success in business. \n', 'So when it came time to look for a better answer to the customer’s challenging \n', 'question, he approached it with that self-same curiosity. He picked up a book, The \n', 'Ecology of Commerce, by Paul Hawken. And by the time he had finished reading it, \n', 'he realized that reading that book was going to change the trajectory of his life.\n', 'Anderson famously described his epiphany as a “spear-in-the-chest mo-\n', 'ment.” He later said that reading The Ecology of Commerce had as good as convicted \n', 'him as being a plunderer of the earth. From that point on, he worked desperately \n', 'to drive the necessary innovations that would allow his publicly traded company \n', 'to take a pledge of sustainability, and set the stage for a new way forward in the \n', 'realm of sustainable business practices.\n', 'For him, the work was never about a personal legacy.

I’d go home \n', 'and have to stay inside, and I remember my parents saying that it was so harmful, \n', 'wondering if we should move away. Living near the ocean, plastic pollution was \n', 'also on the top of my mind.”\n', 'When she was just 32 years old, Hillary’s world came to a screeching halt \n', 'when she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. “I was perplexed, because I had al-\n', 'ways gone to great lengths to live a healthy lifestyle. I ate organic foods, meditated, \n', 'spent my free time in nature and at the ocean.” As a young mother of twins, she \n', 'was desperate to discover what could have led to her health crisis so that she could \n', 'protect her children. “I was so concerned,” she says. “I knew that if this could \n', 'happen to me, it could happen to anyone.” Thinking back to her own childhood, \n', 'she began to wonder if her unhealthy environment had contributed to her disease.\n', 'Hillary was shocked to hear on an NPR radio program about a study by \n', 'the Environmental Working Group that had found that toxic chemicals found in \n', 'women’s personal care products were being found in their babies’ blood. “When \n', 'I researched endocrine-disrupting chemicals, I discovered they were in all of the \n', 'products I was buying to look and feel beautiful. How could the beauty industry \n', 'be selling products with these toxins in them to the people they are claiming to \n', '343\n', 'want to help look and feel better?”\n', 'With a sense of both indignance and determination, Hillary embarked on a \n', 'mission to fill the gap that the industry was so callously ignoring. That is how, and \n', 'why, she began True Botanicals—a non-toxic beauty enterprise “to give people \n', 'the chance to look and feel better because they were using a product that was \n', 'actually making their skin healthier.” With Hillary’s rigorous dedication to using \n', 'non-toxic ingredients and employing sustainable business practices, True Botan-\n', 'icals quickly became a guidepost for the cosmetics industry. Because of her un-\n', 'flinching standards, she has gained the support of a wide range of environmental \n', 'advocates and celebrities like Laura Dern and Olivia Wilde.\n', '“When I opened up my email to see a message from Laura Dern, I was \n', 'floored!” Hillary says. “She loves our products, and our story, and what we stand \n', 'for.” As it turns out, Laura grew up near Hillary: she too had experienced the \n', 'smog and other kinds of pollution and saw how they were impacting children’s \n', 'health. This is the reason she has always used her platform to lead on important \n', 'environmental issues. “It really matters to have people with a reach stand up for \n', 'causes that empower a sustainable future,” Hillary says. “Laura has helped ex-\n', 'pand the reach of True Botanicals with all the dynamism I could’ve expected, and \n', 'more.”\n', 'For Laura Dern, the issues a leader and her company embody are just as \n', 'important as the integrity of the product itself. “It’s one thing for me to support \n', 'this sustainable company as a customer, but it’s another thing to then meet Hillary, \n', 'and discover the origin story of the company, and the passion that comes with \n', 'wanting to make products that are good for you, good for your children, good for \n', 'the planet—and to care deeply about it. I was interested in continuing the story,” \n', 'Laura says. “As women, and as activists, we’re working to show people that you \n', 'can use your voice to be true, to live with an authentic story and not hide behind \n', 'shame—which is a perfect parallel to wanting to serve people with a company. \n', 'What we’re all doing is leading with the truth.”\n', 'Hillary credits the flourishing of True Botanicals to the authenticity of \n', 'their people, process, and products, which she constantly puts to the test. Every \n', 'product at True Botanicals is certified by Made Safe® certified, a nonprofit that \n', 'screens products against a list of harmful chemical ingredients like behavioral, \n', 'developmental, reproductive, and neuro toxins; carcinogens, endocrine disrup-\n', 'tors, fire retardants, heavy metals, pesticides, toxic solvents, and harmful volatile \n', 'organic compounds (VOCs). True Botanicals has the distinction of being the first \n', 'entire cosmetic line of products to have the Made Safe® certification. Hillary is \n', ' 344\n', 'proud that her company is also Leaping Bunny certified, the gold standard for  \n', 'cruelty-free, non-animal testing in all stages of its product development.\n', 'Sourcing sustainable ingredients is another important guiding principal for \n', 'Hillary, and to achieve this she works with a large network of entrepreneurs with \n', 'a similar worldview, who lift one another up through collaboration and education. \n', '“Whether it’s Birdsong Herb Farm from Vermont, and their organic calendula, \n', 'or Hudson Hemp from New York, and the oils from their regenerative farm, we \n', 'source from a healthy, organic, regenerative cycle, and our products reflect that \n', 'ethos. This is how you build communities. By supporting the businesses out there \n', 'that are doing the right thing, and educating those that want to join. There are \n', 'more than you might think.

At True Botanicals, \n', 'we are about showing a better way forward and how it can be done profitably. \n', 'That is our important work. If conventional beauty product companies don’t \n', 'want to be obsolete, over time they will have to adapt to what we are doing.”\n', 'What makes Hillary so sure that her stance is sound is the demand for just \n', 'and sustainable cosmetics from consumers themselves. “Our industry has a term \n', 'for our highly educated consumer base: ‘skintellectuals’,” she says. “With such \n', 'widescale concern about the health and safety of the cosmetics we use, there is \n', 'no question that in the coming years, eventually ‘clean’ will be the new standard \n', 'across the board. It will not be the exception, but the rule.

While she needs to take synthetic thyroid every day, she \n', 'says there is no doubt that the biggest impact her diagnosis had was on her life \n', 'path and the opportunity to create a meaningful role as the founder of True \n', 'Botanicals. “My twins are now 26, and are both passionately working to have an \n', 'impact of their own, my son as an officer in the Marines, learning all that he can \n', 'about mentorship and leadership, and my daughter as a staff editor at the New \n', 'York Times, telling stories that must be told. And our younger daughter is studying \n', '345\n', 'neuroscience in the hopes of attending medical school. My children and their \n', 'peers give me so much confidence that a more thoughtful, sustainable future is \n', 'within our reach.”\n', 'For those looking to introduce sustainable measures into their businesses, \n', 'Hillary offers some simple advice. “Wherever you are headed, it’s always one step \n', 'at a time. It’s critical to just get started. Everything can’t happen at once, and de-\n', 'pending on the type and size of business you want to manage, your approach will \n', 'be different. Even so, what is true for us is true for any business. Any business can \n', 'analyze its processes and pursue the sustainable option: cut down on packaging, \n', 'go organic, or root out the source of ingredients to ensure that the supply chain is \n', 'just and regenerative. Every bit of good helps.”\n', 'For youth who are interested in building a more sustainable future, Hillary \n', 'knows the task at hand is a mighty one. “When you look at climate change, there \n', 'are so many issues of great importance that face us today. I’m sure for the next \n', 'generation, who are just getting their footing, this can feel completely overwhelm-\n', 'ing. I’ve learned that it can be easy to get weighed down by these challenges.”\n', 'As great as the challenges might seem, she urges youth to focus on what they \n', 'can do, because she knows they have the ability to do something extraordinary. \n', '“Whether it’s through my professional work, or in my own personal journey, I focus \n', 'on what’s possible, and work to make it a reality. It feels like a really positive way \n', 'to spend my time,” she says. “So, when we find ourselves getting overwhelmed by \n', 'challenges, it helps to shift our focus to possibilities.

As a journalist, he’d covered social and environmental issues in over \n', '130 countries in some of the world’s most vulnerable regions, like Sub-Saharan \n', 'Africa and the Middle East. From what he’d seen, the crisis of plastic pollution in \n', 'the waterways was devastating impoverished communities, and the scale of the \n', 'neglect was monumental. Francois was troubled and often thought about this \n', 'problem—and about what could be done.\n', '“You don’t just get out of bed one day and say, ‘I want to manufacture eye-\n', 'glasses out of plastic waste’” he says. “I started to wear glasses later in life, so \n', 'by then they were more on my mind.” One day he thought, “Hey, glasses are \n', 'something people all over the world wear. Frames are made of plastic. Then the \n', 'gears began turning.”\n', 'While Francois had no experience in fashion, he was a quick study. He dis-\n', 'covered that fashion is a $100 billion a year industry, and that it is among the \n', 'most environmentally damaging, ranking only behind oil and gas in terms of its \n', 'negative impact. His vision was ambitious, but it was not unrealistic. He’d worked \n', 'with impact businesses before. “I soon realized that this was a way to create a \n', 'sustainable product that was profitable, and that could help clean up the oceans.”\n', 'In 2016, he put together a team, gathered up 20 kilos of recycled plastic, \n', 'brought it to a processor in Italy, and made Sea2See’s first run of products—20 \n', 'sunglasses. “It was a big idea and there were a lot of skeptics. Even my wife \n', 'thought it was a crazy idea, using marine waste for frames. But there they were.”\n', 'The product was a hit almost immediately. To keep up with growing de-\n', 'mand, Francois began working with fishermen in Spain to gather plastic. He then \n', 'expanded his operation to France. Now he works with African fishing communi-\n', 'ties in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo, and he is hoping to expand to other African \n', '355\n', 'countries as well. Together they clean up polluted waterways while providing a \n', 'much-needed revenue stream for these once marginalized fishermen. “When I \n', 'first went there, they thought I was crazy,” he says. “They wondered why this guy \n', 'was going to pay them for collecting waste.” To his critics, François responded, \n', '“Waste has value. And cleaning it up has a value too—it benefits everyone.”\n', 'Over time François has leveraged the power of this new community of fish-\n', 'ermen to address other regional problems. With the excess plastic that remains \n', 'after the frame-making process, he launched a line of watches that supports the \n', 'nonprofit organization Free the Slaves, to stop child exploitation in places like \n', 'Lake Volta in Ghana, where children are forced to work. “The sale of one watch \n', 'finances two weeks of education for each kid that is saved. Our campaign is called \n', 'Time for Time, because we all have time; and I believe we should give meaning \n', 'to our time by giving back to the most vulnerable among us.” And not all of the \n', 'waste collected by Sea2See goes into glasses or watches: they are also building a \n', 'recycling plant, to provide recycled plastic for industries looking for it.\n', 'In 2017, François took his growing business to Chivas Venture, whose in-\n', 'ternational contest invests in social entrepreneurs with start-up projects. Sea2See \n', 'won Best Start-Up in the 2nd edition of the contest in Spain and went on to the \n', 'finals in Los Angeles. While Sea2See did not receive the gold medal, in a tough \n', 'field of sustainable innovators, Francois did receive a call some months later that \n', 'made his intercontinental trip worthwhile.\n', 'When Spanish movie star Javier Bardem saw Sea2See glasses at the contest \n', 'in Los Angeles, he was so inspired that he asked if he could join François and \n', 'his fishermen for a day on the water. He wanted to bring his film crew along, so \n', 'they could raise awareness about the problem of plastic pollution in the ocean \n', 'and showcase Sea2See’s successful venture. “When Javier came out on the fishing \n', 'boat to support us, it really was a boost. He genuinely wants to use his voice to \n', 'help make a change, and he really did,” Francois says. Together, François and \n', 'Javier created a film campaign that has raised awareness about the dangers that \n', 'single-use plastic straws pose to marine life.\n', 'To thank him for his generous support, François gave Javier a pair of Sea-\n', '2See frames. A few days later, at the Cannes Film Festival, Javier’s wife Penelope \n', 'Cruz wore the frames to a film premier, and Hola, one of the biggest celebrity \n', 'magazines in Spain, featured a signature photograph of her wearing her Sea2See \n', 'frames on their cover. “It’s great that we got that exposure,” François says. “I really \n', 'hope more influential people with a platform decide to take up this cause.”\n', 'As of March 2021, Sea2See had collected 443 tons of plastic for its glasses, \n', ' 356\n', 'all while adhering to the strictest standards of the Cradle to Cradle certified prod-\n', 'ucts program. This program is the benchmark by which sustainable businesses \n', 'are measured, particularly as it pertains to the circular economy. Sea2See has \n', 'received the Platinum distinction in material health, and the Gold certification \n', 'overall, meaning it has achieved excellence in each of the five categories: material \n', 'health, circular economy, renewable energy, water stewardship, and social fairness. \n', 'Francois is very proud of these distinctions. “It proves the purity of our recycled \n', 'raw material,” he says.\n', '“We are proving that there is another way,” he says. “By now, most people \n', 'understand that the linear model of business just doesn’t work. That’s why we \n', 'bring a cyclical point of view to plastic waste cleanup. We are the only business \n', 'that is vertically integrated all the way from waste collection to the final product. \n', 'We hope we can inspire others to do more of the same. It’s important, because \n', 'by giving value to waste, we have an environmental impact on the coastal envi-\n', 'ronment but also a social impact, thanks to the new source of income the waste \n', 'collectors have.”\n', 'And François has in fact succeeded in inspiring others: for example, he was \n', 'invited by sustainability experts in Brussels to speak at a conference on SIDS \n', '(Small Island Developing States), where he met diplomats who were intrigued by \n', 'Sea2See. He was then invited to attend the United Nations World Ocean Confer-\n', 'ence in New York. “When I got there, I was talking with the Minister of Foreign \n', 'Affairs of Brussels, who shocked me by saying, ‘I know you.’ At first I thought \n', 'he must be mistaken.” But then the Minister pulled out his papers and showed \n', 'François how he had written about Sea2See in his remarks. “I am going to talk \n', 'about you at the Assembly today,” he said. “We need to help start-ups that are \n', 'raising the issue of ocean contamination and reusing plastic waste.”\n', 'At the conference, Sea2See was showcased as an example of how to reduce \n', 'marine contamination while creating value for consumers worldwide. “I was \n', 'thrilled to see people catching on to the idea of a circular economy—especially \n', 'those who were advocating for it so passionately.

The change was for a well-known reason. “Air pollution and atmospheric \n', 'changes from climate change.”\n', 'As a child, the importance of giving back to others had been deeply ingrained \n', ' 358\n', 'in him by his mother. “She lived by that example,” Gary says. “She worked in \n', 'soup kitchens, volunteered for presidential candidates, helped at the local hospital, \n', 'or at the Boys and Girls Clubs,” Gary says. He pauses, remembering. “I can’t \n', 'remember a dinnertime conversation where my mother wasn’t saying that it’s up \n', 'to us to give back.”\n', 'Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was another big influence on Gary. The King \n', 'family were friends of Gary’s family, and when Coretta Scott King and her chil-\n', 'dren visited the Hirshberg’s vacation home, Gary spent a lot of time with them, \n', 'just hanging out, talking over meals, listening to Coretta. Then, in 1968 Dr. King \n', 'was assassinated. “I was just 14 at the time, so it really became cemented in me, \n', 'that service wasn’t an option. Service was just what you did.”\n', 'When Gary was in college, he worked in an environmental education camp \n', 'for high school students in Maine. He and his fellow camp guides were responsible \n', 'for managing 26,000 acres of wildlife refuge, and teaching students about the \n', 'importance of environmental preservation. But sadly, all around this amazing \n', 'forest, they could see that the timber industry was cutting down trees.\n', '“While we were putting our hearts and souls into wildlife and conservation, \n', 'all around us we could see these clear cuts, with herbicides and everything else,” \n', 'he says. “The refuge was surrounded by about a million acres of pulp and paper \n', 'land. I got the message that ‘This is bad. We need to work on alternatives.’”\n', 'Coming up with ideas for viable, more sustainable alternatives was some-\n', 'thing Gary had to do often at the family dinner table. His grandfather was a \n', 'successful banker with rather conservative views. “More often than not he would \n', 'slay me with some economic argument; I really didn’t have the answers then,” \n', 'Gary says. “But I learned that business is where all the polluting happens, and \n', 'that while business wasn’t the only problem, it was very definitely not part of the \n', 'solution. So I was really seeking alternatives.”\n', 'Gary understood that if there was going to be change, it needed to come \n', 'from within the business community; and it needed to come in the form of viable \n', 'alternatives. So when he was 23, he joined the think tank New Alchemy and \n', 'immersed himself in the emerging renewable energy industry of wind power.\n', 'New Alchemy was a small start-up: it needed lots of investments to get off \n', 'the ground. Fortunately, very quickly Gary discovered that he was a gifted fund-\n', 'raiser. Within two years, at the age of 25, he became the executive director of the \n', 'company.\n', 'Gary put his fundraising skills to good use for a small organic farming \n', 'school, the Rural Education Center in Wilton, New Hampshire. It wasn’t easy. \n', '359\n', 'In the1980s public funding for environmental projects had dried up under a new \n', 'administration, and competition for the little funding that was available was fierce.\n', 'Gary enjoyed the fringe benefits from the school’s farm. “My partner was \n', 'producing this incredibly delicious, wonderful yogurt, which we would sit around \n', 'eating,” Gary remembers. “And then one day somebody—we’re still not sure who \n', 'it was—said, why don’t we start selling this yogurt?”\n', 'That was the beginning of Stonyfield Farm, which would become the \n', 'world’s leading producer of organic yogurt under Gary’s leadership.\n', 'Turning Stonyfield from the little farming school it was initially into the na-\n', 'tional organic yogurt company it is today, took a lot of hard work and dedication. \n', 'They started out by selling their yogurt at only five stores.\n', '“Night after night, even after milking and after making yogurt, one of us—\n', 'whoever wasn’t milking—would go and do a demo at the store,” Gary remembers. \n', '“We would stand there, and we’d talk to consumers, and we’d simply not let them \n', 'say no.”\n', 'Soon, they were able to sell their yogurt in 10 nearby stores, then in 35. \n', 'Eventually, they were the third largest brand in all of their stores. From the very \n', 'beginning, Gary and his business partner, Samuel, used the packaging of their \n', 'products to educate customers. “It was very simply our way of being able to tell \n', 'our story,” Gary says. “The early packages were like mini lessons in where peo-\n', 'ple’s food comes from.”\n', 'As their brand grew into a real company, Gary and his colleagues at Stony-\n', 'field Farm started using their profits to support all kinds of special projects. Early \n', 'on they decided that 10 percent of their profits would be spent on initiatives to \n', 'fight against climate change. Since then, the company has spearheaded many \n', 'measures to minimize its carbon footprint and to support environmental efforts. \n', 'Some of Stonyfield’s newest initiatives include the OpenTEAM project, the \n', 'StonyFIELDS #playfree initiative, and a new goal of reducing carbon emissions \n', 'by 30 percent by 2030.\n', 'As CEO of Stonyfield, it was important to Gary to incorporate the values \n', 'that had been instilled in him during his childhood – and to reconcile his entre-\n', 'preneurial spirit with service to his community. “I realized that we needed a real \n', 'strategy, an economic strategy,” he says. “Creating an actual economic enterprise \n', 'whose mission is to save family farmers, and try to slow down the urbanization of \n', 'rural land, providing healthy food, all of that: it was very appealing.”\n', 'Gary used every imaginative way he could think of to educate the public \n', ' 360\n', 'about sustainable farming.\n', 'In 1989, the company introduced the Have-a-Cow Educational program, \n', 'through which customers were invited to “adopt” one of the Stonyfield cows. \n', 'Then they would receive regular updates about the cows they had adopted, along \n', 'with information about the issues that small-scale farmers were facing.\n', 'But Gary and his team realized that it wasn’t only the public that needed to \n', 'be educated—farmers, too, needed information and training on how to run their \n', 'farms sustainably. Stonyfield also noticed that the population of organic dairy \n', 'farmers in this region was aging. More and more farmers were getting close to \n', 'the age of retirement with no plans for who would take over the farm when they \n', 'retired. So in 2015 Stonyfield partnered with Wolfe’s Neck Center for Agricul-\n', 'ture and the Environment to establish a first-of-its-kind residential organic dairy \n', 'training program where the younger generation of farmers could learn about \n', 'regenerative farming practices in a two-year apprenticeship program. Addition-\n', 'ally, over time, starting in 2014, Stonyfield built up a network of direct supply \n', 'organic dairy farmers, and they were able to start supplementing their milk supply \n', 'with milk from other local organic farmers. So, first they supplied local farmers \n', 'with the skills and technical assistance they needed to make their businesses grow \n', 'sustainably: then they bought their milk. It was a win-win situation.\n', 'With his hard work and dedication, Gary has managed to grow Stonyfield \n', 'Farms into a national enterprise that is also giving back to the local community—\n', 'just like he had learned to do from his mother and his childhood friends.\n', '“I always say to folks that determination is the most important and underap-\n', 'preciated characteristic needed to be an entrepreneur,” he says. “Nothing takes \n', 'the place of hard work and passion.”\n', 'It really boils down to this: that all life is interrelated. \n', 'We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality,\n', ' tied into a single garment of destiny. \n', 'Whatever affects one destiny, affects all indirectly.\n', 'Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n', '361\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Find the nearest local farmer’s market to your home—it’s fresh food, \n', 'locally produced, and 100% good for the environment. \n', 'Or find a CSA (community supported agriculture) to support: they’ll \n', 'deliver fresh organic food right to your home.\n'], 'tags': [[358, 'agriculture sustainable practices'], [360, 'climate education sustainable farming'], [360, 'community service'], [359, 'deforestation Maine'], [358, 'food industry sustainable businesses'], [358, 'health healthy foods'], [358, 'Hirshberg, Gary'], [359, 'King Gary Hirshberg and'], [361, 'King quotes by'], [359, 'New Alchemy'], [358, 'New Hampshire'], [360, 'organic farming'], [361, 'regenerative farming'], [360, 'Stonyfield Farm'], [358, 'sustainable agriculture'], [358, 'sustainable business models food industry'], [358, 'sustainable farming'], [360, 'yogurt, organic']]}, '83': {'person': 'Maria Ressa', 'title': 'Speaking Truth To Power', 'start_page_number': '362', 'end_page_number': '366', 'story': ['Speaking Truth To Power\n', 'Maria Ressa | The Philippines\n', 'Maria Ressa has been fighting for her voice to be heard all her life.

In other words, the little Rappler-mobile became a lifeline.\n', 'Rappler was just a small news media startup with a staff of about ten people \n', 'at the time, but when they beat many of the biggest news outlets in the Philip-\n', 'pines to the scene in the aftermath of the typhoon, the small team of journalists \n', 'knew that they were filling an important void—one where journalism doesn’t just \n', 'inform readers and viewers, but truly serves them on a human level.\n', 'Maria’s job hasn’t been simple.

Few may have heard of the small African country of Burundi. \n', 'But the country, located at the intersection of Africa’s Great Lakes region, the \n', 'plains of East Africa and the Great Rift Valley, has a special place in the continent. \n', 'Burundi is known as the “heart of Africa.”\n', 'It was here that Leila spent the first 10 years of her life. She lived with her \n', 'family in Bujumbura, the largest city and a key port for goods like coffee and ore. \n', 'She remembers the central market and the church her family attended. Every-\n', 'body in her neighborhood knew one another well and there was a strong sense of \n', 'community. Neighbors spoke with neighbors and supported one another.\n', 'However, the drier weather was making it harder to grow crops and people \n', 'were being forced migrate to the cities. “The dry season it getting so dry, it doesn’t \n', 'rain enough, so people don’t have enough food to eat,” she says. “The soil is bad, \n', 'and the pollution is bad. Everybody is moving into the city because they don’t \n', 'have enough food to survive.”\n', 'The increasing lack of food undermined her country’s peaceful coexistence, \n', 'where there was an unsettling feeling of instability that would soon spread across \n', 'the small country. That instability—spurred by a whirlwind of politics, prejudice \n', 'and poverty—eventually erupted in the 1990s, when Leila was just a child. The \n', 'heart of Africa nearly stopped beating, ripped apart by a brutal civil war.\n', 'The Civil War didn’t happen overnight and it didn’t spread to Bujumbura \n', 'immediately. “You would hear gunshots and you knew you weren’t always safe, \n', 'but we kind of got used to it,” she says. “We slept with our clothes on in case we \n', 'had to run in the middle of the night. We just made fun of it. The war was always \n', 'something in the back of our minds.”\n', 'By the time she was 10 years old, in 2000, her parents decided it was no \n', ' 374\n', 'longer safe to live in Burundi. So they moved to Belgium as refugees. Moving to \n', 'a new country, and a new continent, at such a young age wasn’t easy for Leila. \n', 'Even though her new classmates were friendly—she remembers them smiling at \n', 'her and trying to connect with her—it still took her a while to make friends. And \n', 'though she had long dreamt of Europe as a sort of promised land, she learned \n', 'that the reality of it was not that simple.\n', '“When I arrived in Belgium, I had spoken Kirundi my whole life, and learned \n', 'French only at school, but not enough to feel comfortable in a conversation. Plus, I \n', 'was the only black girl in my classroom,” she says. “It’s a lonely moment when you \n', 'realize, oh, wow, you thought it would be a dream, but when you get there, you \n', 'have to overcome a lot of things and learn a new culture, learn a new language,” \n', 'she says. “The temperature is different, the social environment is different, every-\n', 'thing is different.”\n', 'Being a curious child turned out to be her greatest asset that kept her posi-\n', 'tive through this major life change. Keeping an open mind and asking questions \n', 'helped her to get to know this new, unfamiliar environment. “Instead of seeing \n', 'things as a difficulty, you just try to see it’s a good opportunity to learn something \n', 'different,” she says. “Don’t be afraid and don’t stay in your corner. Be open and \n', 'just make the best of each situation.”\n', 'Soon Leila began to become more confident and with confidence came suc-\n', 'cess. She eventually learned several more languages—including French, English, \n', 'Dutch, and Swahili—and she was accepted to law school to pursue her passion \n', 'for social justice.\n', 'All the while, Leila was blossoming into a lovely young woman. At nearly \n', 'six feet tall, with high structured cheekbones and dark eyes, she began to catch \n', 'the attention of modeling agencies, in Belgium and Europe. People told her she \n', 'looked like Naomi Campbell, the British model and entrepreneur.\n', 'At first Leila brushed aside the requests to model. Her mother was reluctant \n', 'for her to start a modeling career. Back home in Burundi, there were strong gen-\n', 'der norms and social mores that prevented girls like her from pursuing modeling. \n', 'It just wasn’t a “thing” for girls like her, she was told. Where her mother saw a \n', 'dead end, Leila saw an opportunity. Not just to lead a successful career, but to \n', 'inspire other girls like her around the world. Eventually, with a little help from her \n', 'sister, she was able to convince her mom to let her give it a try.\n', 'Then her fashion career caught fire. She appeared in shoots for Vogue and \n', 'Harper’s Bazaar among other magazines. This started her on a new journey, to \n', 'NYC where she lives now. “That’s another dream that came true for me,” she says. \n', '375\n', '“But once again I had to start all over by adapting, and learning about the fashion \n', 'industry, with its set of values. That led to building my career; having a voice; and \n', 'becoming the woman I am today: a blend of three cultures—African, European, \n', 'and American.”\n', 'Now, as Burundi’s first top model, she’s walked the runway wearing the \n', 'dresses of some of the most well-known fashion designers: Oscar de la Renta, \n', 'Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Hermes and others. From Fashion Week in Paris, to Milan \n', 'and New York City, her career takes her around the globe, where she’s become, in \n', 'her own words, a “citizen of the world.”\n', 'Her mom has now become her number one fan. “She’s so proud because \n', 'she realized that it’s just a job—no different from any other job,” Leila says. “It’s \n', 'just a different path.”\n', 'Over the years Leila’s life path has inspired young black girls in Belgium, Bu-\n', 'rundi and across the African continent—showing them there is a place for them \n', 'in the modeling world. With a growing influence and platform, she looked for \n', 'ways to be a force for good, helping girls who are struggling to find their way in \n', 'conflict-affected countries like hers.\n', 'Growing up, Leila had seen Marguerite “Maggy” Barankitse on TV sharing \n', 'about her work with Maison Shalom. “In her speeches, she talks about human-\n', 'ity, about forgiveness, about hope,” says Leila. She was touched by how Maggy \n', 'helps orphans gain access to a better future through loving support and education. \n', 'Founded in 1993, Maggy adopted 30 orphans in Burundi during the civil war, \n', 'and has gone on to help thousands more. She won peace prizes and would tour \n', 'European countries and reach out to the Burundi diaspora to raise awareness and \n', 'ask for support. “What she has done is just amazing!” says Leila.\n', 'Inspired by Maggy’s work, Leila began to use her model platform as a force \n', 'for good. She knew that her life could easily have gone this way. Had one of the \n', 'bombs or gunshots she’d heard going off as a child, she or her family could very \n', 'well have been in the line of fire. Five years ago there was another crisis and \n', '300,000 people left the country. Maggy had to flee the country to the neighboring \n', 'country of Rwanda, where she opened another house for Burundi’s refugees.\n', 'In 2018 Leila wrote to Maggy asking how she might help. Since then, she \n', 'has leveraged the power of the media to bring attention to Maison Shalom. She’s \n', 'given interviews bringing light to the crisis in Burundi, and visited a refugee camp \n', 'in Rwanda where she met with some of the young people displaced by the war. “If \n', 'I can be that channel to just open up people and even the young generation, I want \n', 'them to just do something because it’s not something that only the international \n', ' 376\n', 'community can do. It’s like everybody as an individual should do something.”\n', 'Then for Christmas in 2019 Leila visited Maison Shalom’s house in Rwan-\n', 'da’s capital city of Kigali. “I imagined it would be sad, like an orphanage,” she \n', 'says. Leila was pleasantly surprised to see all children dressed up in their uni-\n', 'forms—performing: singing, dancing, and smiling. “They really made me cry—it \n', 'reminded me of when I was little. It was just really beautiful.”\n', 'Maggy gives the children all these opportunities in life—to go to school, to \n', 'learn how to cook, and to get a job. Some choose art and others choose other \n', 'career paths. Most importantly she gives them dignity. “She wants them to feel \n', 'like this is just a moment in their life, that it doesn’t define the rest of their life,” \n', 'says Leila. She wants to build a strong generation of young people who can then \n', 'become the leaders their country so desperately needs. “If you give a hand in life, \n', 'that’s really what matters.”\n', 'As climate change increases the instability in countries across East Africa, \n', 'Leila feels a sense of urgency about increasing support for Maison Shalom.

It was the first day \n', 'of spring break for her high school, Campbell Hall School in Studio City. She’d \n', 'been looking forward to celebrating with her friends by hiking the nearby trails \n', 'and having a picnic. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S., and her home-\n', 'town of Los Angeles, like almost everywhere else in the world, was in lockdown. \n', 'So for Demi, a normal birthday party was just out of the question.\n', 'The night before her birthday, Demi’s friends surprised her with socially- \n', 'distanced picnic. Then, for the actual day, her father had an idea. As a partner \n', 'at WME, a major talent agency, Richard Weitz represents well- known musicians \n', 'who’d been affected by the pandemic. Of necessity, everyone had stopped going \n', 'to live concerts, or listening to jazz at their favorite clubs: cancelled concerts and \n', 'engagements meant lost income for them.\n', 'Demi’s father had just gotten a text from a friend, a piano player in Chicago, \n', 'asking him if there was any way they could lift people’s spirits. An idea was born—\n', 'with a virtual birthday party for Demi at their kitchen table, with 40 friends and \n', 'family connected via Zoom. “My dad invited his friend Debbie Gibson,” says \n', 'Demi. “And someone else invited John Mayer who sang my favorite song, Don’t \n', ' 378\n', 'Stop Believing.” Then together, these two recording artists harmonized singing Hap-\n', 'py Birthday to Demi, and everyone joined in. “It was the coolest day of my life,” \n', 'Demi says. “I was like, ‘What has just happened?!’”\n', 'While she was being serenaded by Debbie Gibson and John Mayer, a \n', 'thought occurred to Demi. This was such a great way to gather people, to create \n', 'a sense of community, and to let them enjoy music without leaving the safety of \n', 'their homes. Why not organize Zoom concerts, invite people, and ask them to \n', 'donate money for a good cause? Thus was born Quarantunes. “I realized that \n', 'with Zoom, we have this amazing platform,” Demi says. “It’s a really great way \n', 'to connect people!”\n', 'Growing up in L.A. as the daughter of a successful agent, Demi is well aware \n', 'of her privilege. She is careful not to come across as spoiled, to drop names, or to \n', 'feed off of someone else’s work. “I’m the opposite of a flashy person,” she says. “I \n', 'try to understand my privilege and my good fortune.”\n', 'In order to make her idea happen, Demi had to learn a whole new skill set, \n', 'so she got busy. She started by setting up a GoFundMe page. Then she wrote a \n', 'short description about the first organization she chose to benefit. Every Christ-\n', 'mas, her family had supported their local community’s free clinic: they would \n', 'bring holiday cheer by “adopting a family,” buying gifts for the children and food \n', 'for the whole family. Sometimes they helped out with rent and medical expenses \n', 'too. Over the years, they’d adopted the same family, so Demi had been able to see \n', 'for herself the kinds of challenges they faced.\n', 'As she planned for the first Quarantunes concert, Demi set a goal of raising \n', '$10,000, then her father encouraged her to up the ante to $30,000. Demi was \n', 'thrilled when they surpassed their goal, raising $33,000. She knew what a differ-\n', 'ence it would make to the clinic. “This was an opportunity to start something that \n', 'is my own—and to give back,” Demi says. “I’m using this, and the things that I’ve \n', 'been given, to make a change.”\n', 'In high school, Demi had been an activist - joining her friends in protest-\n', 'ing gun violence, and working for women’s rights. In the fall of 2019, she made \n', 'posters for the Global Climate Action Strike with some of her environmentalist \n', 'friends. “They have inspired all of us to do the little things we can,” she says. “Like \n', 'switching from using single-use plastic water bottles to reusable water bottles.”\n', 'Living in Beverly Hills, Demi could see that under all the sparkle of celebrity \n', 'life was a serious crisis: 60,000 people were living on the streets in the “City of \n', 'Angels.” She could also see that low-income people were the most vulnerable to \n', 'the effects of climate change. Global warming is blamed for the five-fold increase \n', '379\n', 'in areas burnt in California over the last five decades: and in 2019 the housing \n', 'crisis in Los Angeles was exacerbated when 7,860 wildfires burned more than \n', '250,000 acres of land.\n', 'Then came the pandemic, and everyone was scrambling to provide shelter \n', 'for those 60,000 people. Clinics were in desperate need of support to provide ser-\n', 'vices and PPEs for all the homeless. “It’s a really bleak time,” Demi says. “People \n', 'are losing their jobs; they can’t even put a meal on the table for their families.”\n', 'This was an injustice that Demi was unwilling to accept. So, for the third \n', 'Quarantunes concert, she researched her options, and decided to partner with the \n', 'United Way Greater Los Angeles, the largest agency working with the homeless. \n', 'Someone offered to match all donations up to $50,000. And on April 4, 2020, \n', 'for two hours, while musicians entertained 200 of her friends via Zoom, Demi \n', 'worked her magic. She received enough donations to meet the challenge, and the \n', 'amount she brought in was doubled. “We ended up raising $100,000 in just 30 \n', 'hours,” she says. “It was amazing!”\n', 'Demi was really happy that with the funds they had raised, hundreds of \n', 'homeless people were given safe shelter in motel rooms, and Wellness Kits with \n', 'hand sanitizer, gloves, and face masks. Encouraged with their success, Demi and \n', 'her father decided to organize additional fundraising concerts. After organizing \n', 'just 10 Zoom benefit concerts, she had raised over $3,000,000. And as of April \n', '2021, they’ve raised $20 million and counting!\n', 'Her success is no surprise, considering the high-profile acts she gets to play: \n', 'John Legend, Rod Stewart, Sting, and James Bay, among others, have performed \n', 'for Quarantunes events. “You can see these artists in their homes, and me and \n', 'my dad in our kitchen—it’s a very welcoming and inviting space,” Demi says. I \n', 'feel like everyone’s on the same playing field. It’s like, we’re inviting you into our \n', 'home; and these artists are inviting you into theirs.”\n', 'Meanwhile, on some level, Demi’s days are like those of any other teenager \n', 'in quarantine. Her education is her #1 priority. To keep up with her schoolwork, \n', 'she is home schooling by Zooming with her teachers and classmates. “Then, in \n', 'between English and Math class, I go to my dad’s room, and jump in on a call,” \n', 'she says.\n', 'Behind the scenes, Demi is becoming a businesswoman. “My father’s life is \n', 'music,” she says. So, he’s in charge of inviting his musician friends to participate. \n', 'Demi and her father work together to set goals, and respond to donors’ requests. \n', 'Each week she researches potential beneficiaries and prepares interview questions \n', 'for the representatives of the organization, searching for the right match. “I’m \n', ' 380\n', 'learning so many aspects of the business” she says. And while she was once fearful \n', 'of public speaking, she now has lots of practice honing her speaking skills, as she \n', 'shares her passion for each organization’s work with her dad’s friends.\n', '“Usually I’ll interview someone that runs an organization - and we’ve had \n', 'some frontline workers on the Zoom call.

Getting to hear from those in \n', 'charge of fighting the pandemic has been both educational and shocking, Demi \n', 'says. “Every call has been so inspiring,” Demi says. “You are hearing from people \n', 'from all different walks of life, with different experiences.”\n', 'Quarantunes’s support for local charities has now grown to include national \n', 'organizations, like the United Way’s relief efforts in six other cities. Beyond raising \n', 'money for the homeless, for clinics and food banks, Demi likes to educate people \n', 'who join their events. “All of their stories were very inspiring,” Demi says. “It’s \n', 'real and authentic—that’s the most beautiful part.”\n', 'Given her father’s national network of generous friends, Quarantunes has \n', 'been able to help in pandemic hot spots like New City’s public hospitals.

So, when the \n', 'Hollywood Bowl was closed for the first time in its 98-year history, people were \n', 'understandably upset. Every year this iconic outdoor venue is for many people \n', 'a favorite summer activity. Breathing fresh air under the overarching trees and \n', 'enjoying expansive views of the city, it offers people a welcome respite from their \n', 'busy lives and noisy highway traffic. Listening to their favorite musicians, it was \n', 'heavenly. And it is every musicians’ dream to one day play there.\n', 'So, when it was abruptly closed, Demi and her dad came up with a “wild \n', 'and crazy” idea. They made lots of phone calls and got permission to use it as \n', 'the venue for their 10th Quarantunes concert. They extended the limit to 1,000 \n', 'invitation-only guests—and kept it a secret. The concert was cohosted by music \n', 'legend and rainmaker, Clive Davis, who spoke of the power of music to unite, \n', 'and shared personal stories about each guest. The guests included Kenny Loggins \n', '381\n', '(who sang “Footloose”) and Gloria Gaynor (who sang “I Will Survive”), as well \n', 'as Barry Manilow, Santana, and Rob Thomas. Orchestra leader John Williams \n', 'opened the evening with the overture to Star Wars, with the trumpet section per-\n', 'forming on the Hollywood Bowl stage – all with social distancing, of course. And \n', 'Kevin Bacon did zoom dancing.\n', 'Demi is very proud of the beneficiaries they had chosen for this event: \n', 'Share Our Strength’s Billy Shore spoke about No Kid Hungry, proclaiming “This \n', 'is a problem we can solve.” Members of the Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles \n', 'members played a short piece. And Billie Ellish talked about her mother’s vegan \n', 'meal-delivery charity Support + Feed. One appreciative person on the Zoom \n', 'call said, “You are changing the narrative—from fear, anxiety, and isolation, to \n', 'connection and community.”\n', 'For Demi what started as an unusual birthday celebration has become a \n', 'life-changing experience.

Born in the Unit-\n', 'ed States with dual citizenship in Peru, she was raised in a small town in New \n', 'Jersey. From a young age, her parents had instilled in her a strong work ethic, \n', 'and morals that were guided by their Christian faith. Her family is a warm and \n', 'loving one, and she was particularly close to her mother. “My mother had a very \n', 'traditional upbringing,” Betsabe says. “So she has a wealth of insight to offer.”\n', 'But at school, Betsabe was more like an outcast. She didn’t enjoy school very \n', 'much, and she wasn’t sure what she wanted to do when she grew up. And as the \n', 'only Latina child in her class, she felt uncomfortable.\n', 'But all that changed at the age of 16 when she was offered the opportunity \n', 'to travel to Mexico with 30 other kids. In the summer of 2012, Betsabe traveled to \n', 'a small village in Mexico near Tijuana with her church’s youth group to volunteer \n', 'in an orphanage and work with the local community. There she witnessed a great \n', 'deal of violence in the streets, and heard stories about domestic abuse. It was both \n', 'shocking and scary for her to see this happening. The culture was so different than \n', 'the one she’d grown up in. It opened her eyes to the fact that some people live in \n', 'a very dangerous world, even in their own homes: and it instilled in her a passion \n', 'to do what she could to protect them and do what she could to help.\n', '383\n', 'Ever since that life-changing trip to Mexico, Betsabe has found ways to im-\n', 'merse herself in other cultures and other countries. And wherever she travels, she \n', 'tries to use her voice to speak out against the inequalities, and the injustice, that \n', 'makes the lives of so many people around the world so difficult.\n', 'In college, Betsabe studied theology and went on exchange to York, England. \n', 'While she knew that she wanted to do good in the world, she was unsure of how \n', 'to go about it. She had passion and drive, but she also needed direction, and \n', 'guidance. Then, several of her professors nominated Betsabe to travel to Greece \n', 'as a volunteer to help refugees. Along with five classmates, Betsabe spent three \n', 'weeks in Athens.\n', 'When she arrived in Greece, the mood in the Olympic stadium in Athens \n', 'was far different than the glorious fanfare of the summer games that had been \n', 'held there almost 15 years earlier. Then it was a spirit of celebration: now the \n', 'stadium was filled with thousands of desperate Afghani and Persian refugees who \n', 'were passing through Greece. The resources needed to help these people survive, \n', 'let alone build new lives, were just not available. All there was for them was an \n', 'empty cement building, bleachers, and a playing field. To make it worse, three \n', 'times a day, buses would unload more refugees at the stadium, sometimes hun-\n', 'dreds of people at a time. So it was overwhelming, and very discouraging.\n', 'Betsabe was assigned to distribute food, offer basic medical care, and refer \n', 'people to doctors and nurses when necessary. She and the other volunteers did \n', 'the best they could to help. It was hard work, and it was disheartening to not be \n', 'able to do more. But the people were really suffering and clearly needed her help, \n', 'so she knew she couldn’t just run away from the challenges. She dedicated herself \n', 'completely to her work and tried not to focus on all that she couldn’t do. Together, \n', 'this small team of 11 people helped several thousand people. Betsabe continued \n', 'her service for another 14 days at another refugee camp to help to manage the \n', 'program’s finances.\n', 'After graduating from college, Betsabe was trying to figure out what she \n', 'should do next when a thought came to her to travel to Turkey. At this time, Tur-\n', 'key had the highest concentration of displaced persons and refugees in the world. \n', 'She knew she was needed there.\n', 'At first, her mother wasn’t so enthusiastic about her going to that part of the \n', 'world. She was afraid that it could be dangerous. But she could see Betsabe’s pas-\n', 'sionate desire for positive change, and she didn’t want to stand in the way. So she \n', 'reached out to a friend who did mission work in Turkey, and who could provide \n', 'Betsabe with connections on the ground; and members of her church helped raise \n', ' 384\n', 'the money to pay her way.\n', 'When she got to Turkey, Betsabe traveled with five others in a small minivan, \n', 'arriving at a refugee camp just a short walk away from the Syrian border. Due to \n', 'the sensitivity of the mission, she had hardly any details about where she would \n', 'be stationed or what she would be doing before she got there. She’d had to put \n', 'her trust in God and in the organizing group. Now she discovered that she was \n', 'on the front lines of the refugee crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians were \n', 'fleeing from Bashar al-Assad’s brutal regime in Syria, and Turkey was often the \n', 'first border they crossed.\n', 'She had to put a lot of faith in God to help her through this time. All the pain \n', 'and suffering seemed unbearable to her otherwise. Regardless of their religion or \n', 'culture, Betsabe saw the people staying in the refugee camp as her brothers and \n', 'sisters. “Everyone fleeing violence and persecution is a human being,” she says. \n', '“No one chooses to be a refugee.”\n', 'One day, a group of five men drove up to the refugee camp in a pickup \n', 'truck. They opened fire and shot several of the men in the camp. Betsabe and \n', 'her coworkers hid in their minivan, hoping to stay safe. And it was while she was \n', 'huddling inside the van that she had a crushing realization. Her ability to escape \n', 'the gunfire and hide away gave her considerable privilege. Those staying in the \n', 'camp did not have that option. Once again, she promised herself that she would \n', 'do whatever she could to protect them.\n', 'These refugees were people who had been living normal lives before—peo-\n', 'ple with families, and jobs, and pets, and romances, and favorite books, and as-\n', 'pirations. “I realized that at any moment, normal life can be taken away from \n', 'anyone,” she says. And with the problems caused by climate change creating an \n', 'ever-increasing number of refugees in the world—by 2019 the UN reported there \n', 'were 70.8 million refugees worldwide—Betsabe knows very well that this is a \n', 'problem that is not going to just go away. In fact it is growing rapidly, even alarm-\n', 'ingly. “As long as I can, I will continue to fight for those who are suffering, and not \n', 'take anything for granted. Protecting the rights of people around the world is as \n', 'important to me as protecting my own family,” she says.\n', 'Now back in New Jersey, Betsabe is preparing for her future by studying \n', 'political science at Rutgers University.

By then, the senior Cesar Chavez was traveling most of the time.\n', 'Little Cesar often heard stories about his grandfather; about how he had \n', 'awakened Americans nationwide to the plight of migrant farm workers in Cali-\n', 'fornia and convinced them to join them in boycotting one of their favorite fruits—\n', 'grapes. It took five long years, but eventually they got the farm owners to make \n', 'concessions—to stop using deadly pesticides - and that made a huge difference in \n', 'people’s lives.\n', 'Little Cesar often saw his grandfather on TV, as he went around the state, \n', 'inspiring union workers, demanding fair contracts from farmers, and challenging \n', 'state officials to care for all of their people. He always closed with the same mes-\n', 'sage: “When you have people together who believe in something very strongly \n', '- whether it’s religion or politics or unions - things happen,” he would tell them. \n', '“We can choose to use our lives for others; to bring about a better, and more just, \n', 'world for our children.”\n', 'It was always exciting when Cesar, the “gentle giant,” would finally come \n', '387\n', 'home from his travels. Most of the United Farm Workers (UFW) families lived \n', 'together on a 200-acre ranch near the Tehachapi Mountains, which had once \n', 'been a health center for people with tuberculosis. It had also once served as a \n', 'movie set. Then the director of the film sold it to the UFW for just $1. Cesar \n', 'called it “La Paz,” for the peacefulness he felt there. Being in nature was always \n', 'the best medicine to help him rest, especially after a long journey.\n', 'Cesar named their communal kitchen, where the community would share \n', 'meals together, Pan Y Vino (Bread and Wine). “He had studied cultures where the \n', 'people who worked together, ate together,” his grandson explains. He loved to \n', 'watch the children running around, sharing stories with his devoted community \n', 'of comrades. “All the volunteers working with the union, they weren’t just work-\n', 'mates—they were our friends, people we trusted and depended on.”\n', 'For most of his life, young Cesar lived next door to his grandfather. By the \n', 'time he woke up at 6:00 a.m. to go to school, he’d see his grandfather already \n', 'walking down the dirt road to begin his workday. Often, he’d come home late at \n', 'night. “I always knew he was really busy,” Cesar says, adding, “But he always took \n', 'time for us.”\n', 'After school, Cesar would stop by his grandfather’s office. “He’d stop what-\n', 'ever he was doing, even during meetings,” Cesar remembers. “He’d bring us in \n', 'and introduce us to everyone, then hug us and tell us he was busy and that we \n', 'should do our homework and come back later to visit.”\n', 'What he remembers most are the long hikes they’d take together into the \n', 'mountains. “He’d show me these beautiful trails, and places he called our secret \n', 'caves,” he says. “And we’d talk about grandfather- grandson things.”\n', 'A devoted student of Mahatma Gandhi, Cesar Chavez often fasted to bring \n', 'much-needed media attention to the farmworkers’ struggle. In 1987, he started \n', 'the Fast for Life. Little Cesar, who was just six, visited him every day and brought \n', 'him water. He fondly remembers the long hugs his grandfather would give him.\n', 'To Cesar, it seemed like a normal childhood, except that they lived at the \n', 'UFW headquarters. On Friday nights, all of Cesar’s cousins would join with his \n', 'father in the big hall to silkscreen the UFW’s black eagle onto red flags. “It was \n', 'great fun,” Cesar says. “We’d run with each flag to the end of the hall, lay it out \n', 'to dry, and run back for the next one.” By the end of the night there would be \n', 'thousands of flags laying all over the floor, waiting to be put onto poles. Cesar \n', 'would go to bed exhausted, but happy knowing the next day he’d see everyone \n', 'waving the flags, and that he had played a part.\n', 'Sometimes his grandfather would remind Cesar and his cousins of the \n', ' 388\n', 'deeper meaning of their work. Even though he had been born and raised in the \n', 'United States and served in the Army, he had felt the pain of being treated like a \n', 'second-hand citizen. He wanted his people to retain pride in their own heritage \n', 'as well in the contributions they had made to their new home. “Symbols are im-\n', 'portant,” he would say. “We chose the Aztec eagle for our symbol, because it gives \n', 'us pride. When our people see it, they feel a sense of dignity.”\n', 'Saturday mornings, Cesar, and his family and friends, would all pile into \n', 'station wagons and caravan down to that day’s march, strike, or demonstration \n', 'in Los Angeles or San Diego; or sometimes at their local supermarkets. While \n', 'their parents formed picket lines, the children would walk around the parking lot \n', 'passing out fliers and asking people for donations. Young and old, they each did \n', 'their part, in solidarity with those who were working away in hot fields without \n', 'health benefits, or enough food to feed their own families.\n', 'Cesar always wanted the children to walk close by him in the front of the \n', 'marches. He found joy and energy in their youthful enthusiasm and the songs \n', 'they’d sing, like “De Colores.” Along the way, the children often learned import-\n', 'ant lessons from him. “One time a van of children drove by flipping us off,” young \n', 'Cesar remembers. “We were mad–but my grandfather just waved to them and \n', 'gave them a big smile,” he says. “Later he talked with us about the importance of \n', 'nonviolence, of just being nice to one another. And he would say ‘There is enough \n', 'love and goodwill in our movement to give energy to our struggle and still have \n', 'plenty left over to change the climate of hate and fear around us.’”\n', 'Sometimes young Cesar and his cousins would become discouraged by the \n', 'seemingly overwhelming odds against them. “Our opponents in the agricultural \n', 'industry are very powerful; and farm workers are weak in money and influence,” \n', 'their grandfather would say. “But we have another kind of power that comes from \n', 'the justice of our cause. If we are willing to sacrifice for the cause, and persist in \n', 'nonviolence; and if we work to spread the message of our struggle, millions of \n', 'people around the world will respond from their hearts, will support our efforts...\n', 'And in the end, we will overcome.” Then, renewed by his heartfelt words, every-\n', 'one would smile, and shout out, “Viva la Causa!”\n', 'Cesar’s grandfather had always nourished his love for learning. Since he \n', 'himself had never had a chance to finish the eighth grade, he strongly encouraged \n', 'his people to stay in school and get a good education. And even though they were \n', 'making progress, he was troubled that Latinos were still dropping out of school at \n', 'record levels. Some had to leave, to get jobs so they could help feed their families. \n', 'However, too many were dropping out for the wrong reasons.\n', '389\n', 'Cesar Chavez knew that oppressed people throughout history often missed \n', 'out on getting an education. He also knew that the key to sustaining the move-\n', 'ment was to educate people about the issues; to help them distinguish facts from \n', 'myths, let them know what progress was being made, and learn about the battles \n', 'being won by their brothers and sisters in other parts of the country. He was \n', 'troubled that most books about the movement weren’t available in Spanish, so his \n', 'people couldn’t read about how they were making history.\n', 'On many levels, Cesar Chavez was way ahead of his time. Long before the \n', 'technology was ready, he had dreamed of creating a network of radio stations to \n', 'educate and entertain his people. He was determined to find a way to keep them \n', 'connected with up-to-date news so they could quickly respond when called to ac-\n', 'tion. He wanted to build on their Latino oral tradition, by passing on their history \n', 'through storytelling. He first tried to buy ad space on the local radio stations. “But \n', 'back in the 60’s and 70’s, the stations were all owned by the growers,” he told his \n', 'grandson. “They threw us out and told us never to come back.”\n', 'Undeterred, he pursued his dream in a most unconventional way. He de-\n', 'signed a plan to invent a makeshift microwave telephone system and received \n', 'a grant from the state of California to implement it. The phone system, with \n', 'satellite dishes on the mountaintops soon became the second largest in California, \n', 'next to Pacific Bell.\n', 'From an early age, young Cesar had shown promise in technology and had \n', 'taken an electronics class in high school. He’d been helping his father run the \n', 'UFW’s audio-visual equipment and installing their phone and alarm systems. “I \n', 'ran all the wire in the attics and basements, crawling through spider webs,” Cesar \n', 'says of his early adventures into the world of technology. So, he was a natural \n', 'candidate to help his grandfather build this new communications system. Soon he \n', 'was climbing mountains with his father, installing the satellite dishes and connect-\n', 'ing people in cities all over California. In the early days, it was quite a challenging \n', 'project. If just one of the dishes went down, half of the cities in the network \n', 'would be disconnected. Sometimes in the middle of the night, they’d have to \n', 'travel to the cold, icy mountaintops to fix one, returning the next morning just in \n', 'time for Cesar to go to school.\n', 'Finally, the project was ready: Cesar’s grandfather applied for their first ra-\n', 'dio license, housed it in the National Farm Workers Service Center, and named it \n', 'Radio Campesina. By May 1, 1983, they were on the air for the first time. Cesar \n', 'warmly welcomed all his listeners, his courageous words ringing out strong and \n', 'true. By November 1990 they were transmitting all the way to Phoenix, Arizona. \n', ' 390\n', 'After many long years, Cesar’s dream was finally starting to come true.\n', 'But he wouldn’t live to see the day when Radio Campesina would be con-\n', 'nected via the latest satellite technology, computers, and digital audio software.\n', 'Cesar Chavez died near where he was born, in Uma, Arizona, where he’d \n', 'been helping to fight another fight for his people. Young Cesar knew that some-\n', 'thing must be wrong when his father came to pick him up at school early one day. \n', 'After putting the younger children in the car, he put his arm around Cesar and \n', 'whispered in his ear, “Tata has passed away.” At first Cesar couldn’t believe his be-\n', 'loved grandfather was gone. But as they drove home, he heard the announcement \n', 'on the radio. Then it hit him, hard.\n', 'Cesar’s grandfather would have been proud of all those with careers in \n', 'law, medicine, and education, who brought their children to his funeral. Rudolfo \n', 'Anaya, known as a father of Chicano literature, gave the eulogy. “Our morning \n', 'star,” he called him. “...that luminous light that greeted workers as they gathered \n', 'around the dawn campfires.” And young Cesar read aloud the Prayer of St. Fran-\n', 'cis Assisi, in honor of his grandfather’s love of nature.\n', 'Cesar is now carrying on his grandfather’s legacy as the director of digital \n', 'strategy at the Cesar Chavez Foundation. “Everything my grandfather fought for \n', 'is still worth fighting for,” he says, and adds, “Every day I realize how much the \n', 'world needs to change, so our people can have equal rights, and peace. I try every \n', 'day to push myself toward that goal, the way my grandfather did.”\n', 'Now every day from 5:30 am to 3:00 pm., Radio Campesina is broadcast \n', 'to people in eight states. During the workday, it lifts workers’ spirits by playing \n', 'Nortena Banda top 40’s music. Local experts are featured on a 30-minute talk \n', 'show.

In fact, they were of the utmost importance in her home. “I remem-\n', 'ber, for instance, that when I learned how to tie my shoes, if I put my left shoe on \n', 'first, I was taught to be sure to tie my right shoe first; because it was important that \n', 'things always be fair. I mean, where does a child pick up an idea like that? It’s got \n', 'to be from their parents. And it certainly was in my case.”\n', 'On their summer trips across the U.S. they’d stop in wilderness areas to raft, \n', 'camp, or hike, so she and her siblings could experience firsthand the many natural \n', 'wonders that this great, expansive country had to offer – which she still advocates \n', 'for to this day.\n', 'But for Kerry’s father, there was always more than that. He was always cam-\n', 'paigning at least part-time, even when they were on a family vacation. Ever an \n', 'advocate for the most vulnerable, he brought Kerry to some of the poorest areas \n', 'in the country, where people were suffering in incredibly difficult conditions, to \n', 'show her how “the other half” lived.\n', 'When they were out west, they would often stop at remote Indian reserva-\n', 'tions and speak with members of the tribe about the problems and issues they \n', 'were facing. When they were in the eastern part of the country, they’d campaign \n', 'in similarly downtrodden locales like rural Appalachia, and her dad’s approach \n', 'was always the same: he always tried to find out what the people needed, and \n', 'how he could help them. And always, Kerry was close by his side, and watching \n', ' 404\n', 'carefully.\n', 'When he ran for president in 1968, she was only 8 years old, but she helped \n', 'in the campaign in any small way she could. “He was always full of laughs and \n', 'fun, and we just loved being around him,” she says. “But he also taught us to \n', 'understand all of the hardships people face in our country.” She remembers that \n', 'above all, her father thought it was important that she understand what public \n', 'service is about. “There are many Americas,” she says. “And it’s a truth that one \n', 'can never be too young to begin trying to understand that.”\n', 'After listening to searing testimony about conditions in Mississippi by Mar-\n', 'ian Wright—a 27-year-old Yale Law School graduate who was working with the \n', 'NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund in the state—to his Senate Subcommittee on Pov-\n', 'erty in April 1967, Kennedy followed Wright through the heart of the Delta, a \n', 'region in northwest Mississippi known for its entrenched racism and suffocating \n', 'poverty. He was joined by fellow senator Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania.\n', 'As he often did, he had brought her siblings along to the meeting. Kerry \n', 'remembers him commanding the room where she and all her brothers and sisters \n', 'were seated. They were a rowdy bunch, but when her father began to speak, a \n', 'rare quiet came over the room, as everyone listened to hear what he would say. He \n', 'looked around the room, shook his head, and then he said, quietly, “I’ve just been \n', 'to a part of this country where three families live in a room the size of this one, \n', 'and I want you to do something to help these children.”\n', 'For Kerry, everything about her dad was interesting, and inspiring. Because \n', 'of his example, she grew up believing that public service was what you wanted to \n', 'do, because that was what made life meaningful. It wasn’t a feeling of obligation, \n', 'or a feeling that was burdensome. It was more a sense of an honorable duty. “But \n', 'that particular instance [at the meeting of the subcommittee on poverty] is the \n', 'only time I remember him saying, “You have to be involved.” She adds, “That mo-\n', 'ment, as much as any, set me up on my journey into advocacy - and particularly \n', 'on a journey toward exposing the many abuses that go on around this world, in \n', 'all of their forms.”\n', 'Tragedy struck Kerry’s family shortly thereafter, when in June 1968, after \n', 'winning the California presidential primary, her father was assassinated. Though \n', 'she was only 8 years old, Kerry knew that she would dedicate her life to carrying \n', 'on the legacy of the noble ideals that her father had believed in so deeply. And \n', 'she would act in accordance with her favorite quote by her father; it laid out a \n', 'pathway for her own future work, and for the life she was going to lead.\n', '405\n', '“Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others,\n', ' or strikes out against injustice,\n', 'he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and \n', 'crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and\n', 'daring those ripples build a current which\n', ' can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”\n', 'To carry on the work of a humanitarian and advocate as great as her father \n', 'was wouldn’t be easy. But Kerry always kept those words in mind. She remem-\n', 'bered them, and believed that each small act of hers would “send forth a tiny \n', 'ripple of hope” into the world, that would build toward a more just future.\n', 'When she was in 6th grade, Kerry took her first public stand in service of \n', 'an ideal. It was 1972, and Watergate was dominating the news cycle. For school, \n', 'she had to write a biography of a famous person. “I chose Cesar Chavez. And my \n', 'best friend said, ‘Who’s Cesar Chavez?’ and I said, ‘Well, how come you’ve never \n', 'heard of him? He’s as famous as Richard Nixon.’ And she said, ‘No, he’s not. I’ve \n', 'never heard of him.’” They argued about the merits of who was more famous \n', 'and who deserved to be more famous – but the important thing for Kerry was her \n', 'belief that Chavez should be a household name. Certainly in her home he had \n', 'an enormous presence. Her family boycotted grapes and lettuce in solidarity with \n', 'the farmers’ struggle. So Kerry knew that Cesar Chavez had a story that needed \n', 'to be told.\n', 'Some 16 years later, in 1988, her father’s words echoed as true as if they \n', 'had just been spoken; as Kerry took a small stand in support of an ideal, and \n', 'that small act in support of Chavez’s struggle led her on a course that brought \n', 'her into contact with the great humanitarian himself. Chavez was embarking on \n', 'his last great fast, and when doctors advised that he must end it or risk death, \n', 'other leaders around the country picked it up and traveled with it. A network of \n', 'human rights advocates and celebrities joined together to bring Chavez’s uplifting \n', 'message of solidarity forward, and Kerry took part in in too. “I had the honor \n', 'of carrying the message forward from New York to Boston,” she says. “It was a \n', 'powerful thing to be a part of.”\n', 'Over the more than 50 years since her father’s tragic death, Kerry has lived \n', 'up to being the fearless humanitarian and advocate for the disinherited that he in-\n', 'spired her to be in more ways than he could have possibly dreamed. What started \n', 'in her kitchen one day, having an argument with her best friend, has blossomed \n', ' 406\n', 'into a life of service few can rival – both in the scope, and the breadth of the issues \n', 'she has fought for.\n', '“Human rights defenders teach us not how to be saints, but how to be fully \n', 'human,” she says. And in all of her work, this is precisely what Kerry has done. \n', 'She has published a number of books, including Speak Truth to Power, which tells \n', 'heroic tales of advocacy; and her writing has been featured in many newspapers. \n', 'She has spoken out in favor of bail reform and other issues that stem from systemic \n', 'racism. She has worked with Break Bread Not Families, to bring awareness to the \n', 'current situation for refugees at the southern border of the United States, through \n', 'fasting and prayer.

While Anna had \n', 'been raised to think about where her food came from, until that trip, the ideas had \n', 'always been abstract for her.\n', 'Growing up, Anna split her time between her parents’ homes, both of whom \n', 'were passionate activists with a common goal: to make the world a healthier, safer, \n', 'more equitable place. Typical family dinner conversations revolved around issues \n', 'of world hunger, social injustice, or the dangers of toxic chemicals. That trip to \n', 'Ohio brought home to her those many conversations over the years.\n', 'Since the 1970s, Anna’s mother, Frances Moore Lappé, had been explor-\n', 'ing the root causes of hunger and inequality in the United States and beyond. \n', 'Through her mother’s work, Anna learned firsthand about the impact of United \n', 'States foreign policy, development aid, and farm programs.

She knew that the lettuce, grapes, and tomatoes that come to \n', 'dinner tables from thousands of miles away also come with grave human and \n', 'environmental costs.\n', 'Anna knew she had to do something. Luckily, she had her mother to guide \n', 'her. Frances Moore Lappé had sparked a revolution with her book, Diet for a Small \n', 'Planet, which has sold over three and a half million copies since it was published \n', 'in 1971. The book radically reshaped the conversation about hunger, helping \n', 'people see that the real cause of hunger is not a scarcity of food, but a scarcity \n', 'of democracy and how our industrial animal agriculture squanders abundance \n', 'in raising factory farmed livestock. The book urges people to adopt a healthy, \n', 'plant-centered diet to minimize the environmental costs of our food consumption \n', 'and provides recipes for such a diet. But more than that, the book encourages \n', 'its readers to see themselves as actively shaping the world around them, through \n', 'everyday choices like what they eat to big choices like what they do with their lives.\n', 'Her mother had always been a role model for Anna: she sparked Anna’s \n', 'curiosity about social justice and the food system. Some of Anna’s most vivid \n', 'childhood memories are of spending time at her mother’s office at the non-profit \n', 'she cofounded, the Institute for Food and Development Policy known as Food \n', 'First. She remembers afternoons on the office couch reading institute newsletters \n', 'and evenings stuffing donation envelopes for fundraising drives with her mother’s \n', 'coworkers. Like her mother, her father also had committed his life to rooting out \n', 'injustice, as a scientist and medical ethicist. These values inspired Anna to study \n', 'international affairs and political economy in graduate school, where she learned \n', 'about the political and economic concepts behind the injustice she had learned \n', 'about growing up.\n', 'Around the 30th anniversary of her mother’s first book, Anna had an idea. \n', 'She proposed that her mom write a sequel: if the original book’s premise was \n', 'that hunger was caused by a scarcity of democracy, where around the world were \n', 'there social movements and civic leaders tackling those roots to create thriving \n', 'communities? This book, too, would include recipes, bringing to life meals that \n', 'celebrate earth’s bounty. Her mother agreed to do it on one condition: that Anna \n', 'work with her.\n', 'Together, Anna and her mother travelled the world, covering five continents; \n', 'meeting passionate leaders and investigating ways to build real food democracy. \n', '409\n', 'They spent time in India, Bangladesh, Poland, Kenya, France, and Brazil.

To date, the Small Planet Fund has given away nearly two million \n', 'dollars and two of its grantees have won the Nobel Peace Prize.\n', 'Working with her mother, Anna realized the importance of generations \n', 'working together for change.

We need leaders \n', 'of all generations to solve the world’s most pressing challenges.”\n', 'Today, Anna is an advocate for better food systems that will protect the envi-\n', 'ronment, promote health, and provide quality jobs with dignity. She has published \n', 'two more books and contributed to more than 12 others. Her most recent is Diet \n', 'for a Hot Planet, which focuses on the link between the global food system and \n', 'the climate crisis—and how food can be a key climate solution. In the book, she \n', 'reveals the climate impact of industrial agriculture, particularly meat and dairy \n', 'production. And she shows how sustainable farming and ranching can help re-\n', 'duce the climate impacts of the sector, even pull carbon out of the atmosphere to \n', 'lock it in our soils. “Farmers and ranchers need to be part of any feasible climate \n', 'solution,” she says. “Unless we stop agribusiness driven rainforest destruction and \n', 'push for a radical transformation in how we farm, the greenhouse gas emissions \n', 'from this sector will continue to rise and contribute to climate change.”\n', 'With these ideas in mind, Anna founded Real Food Media, which exposes \n', 'food industry misinformation and shares the stories of food movement leaders \n', 'around the country.

Today, her \n', 'work aims to help people reflect on the environmental and social implications of \n', 'the food they eat and to see how they, too, can be part of building a food system \n', 'that promotes health, animal welfare, sustainability, and worker wellbeing. “Tak-\n', ' 410\n', 'ing on food is of critical importance if we are to create a sustainable future for \n', 'people living on this planet,” she says.\n', 'Equity, transparency, and accountability are Anna’s key principles.

They wanted to gain a deep understanding of what was \n', '415\n', 'affecting these communities, and formulate a plan of action to help them. The \n', 'most pressing issue facing the Indigenous people of British Columbia (B.C) was \n', 'the destruction of forests caused by clear-cut logging, the pollution of natural \n', 'water systems, and the ramifications of these things on their traditional way of \n', 'life. “Thankfully, my parents always brought us along when they were working \n', 'with these vulnerable communities. I really felt like I was involved, and had a say. \n', 'It was really empowering.”\n', 'Since the late 1970s, the Suzuki family has been courageously fighting for \n', 'environmental and Indigenous rights in B.C. For more than 40 years, geneticist \n', 'David Suzuki has been a mainstay on Canadian television, hosting The Nature of \n', 'Things, a documentary program on nature and society. This platform has allowed \n', 'his family’s message of environmental justice for all to reach a vast audience. But \n', 'the heart, soul, and genesis of their enduring environmental legacy lies with the \n', 'Indigenous peoples of B.C.\n', 'On a work-related trip to the Amazon, the Suzukis met a man who would \n', 'change the direction and the impact of their activism, from small-scale and local, \n', 'to far-reaching and global. Paiakan was an Indigenous leader who was fighting \n', 'against the construction of a massive hydroelectric dam in Brazil, that would \n', 'flood thousands of hectares of pristine rainforest, and destroy countless Indige-\n', 'nous communities. “Of course, my Mom and Dad did what they always did; they \n', 'got involved in the fight,” Severn says. Her mother, Tara, an accomplished writer, \n', 'activist, and organizer, led a fundraising effort that allowed them to bring Paiakan \n', 'to Canada. There, she organized a meeting of Indigenous groups to confront the \n', 'World Bank, which was funding the project – and they succeeded in getting the \n', 'project stopped.\n', 'In the aftermath of this victory, Paiakan and his family received death \n', 'threats, so the Suzukis brought them to Canada to escape danger.\n', 'When it was safe to return to their home the following year, the Suzukis \n', 'traveled with them to ensure their safe arrival, and they were invited to stay in \n', 'Paiaka’s home in the Amazon. “It was transformational for me as a young girl. \n', 'Fishing for piranhas from the banks of the river we had just been swimming in. \n', 'Living in a sparkling green jungle. It was beyond my wildest imagination – and it \n', 'was real,” Severn remembers.\n', 'After a few weeks in the jungle, it was time for the Suzukis to go back home. \n', 'They got into a tiny plane that took them over the jungle toward the nearest \n', 'town; but as they climbed into the sky, their windows quickly became completely \n', 'covered in smoke. “As I got brief glimpses of the jungle below, I saw tons of \n', ' 416\n', 'fires burning everywhere. It was heartbreaking to see this incredible world being \n', 'burned to the ground. Then I saw the farm and cattle operations scarring the land. \n', 'I decided right then and there that I had to do something about it.”\n', 'When Severn arrived home, she told her friends about what she’d experi-\n', 'enced, and how she wanted to help preserve these pristine places. She quickly \n', 'gained support from her peers, who understood the importance of her mission \n', '– but they didn’t know where or how to direct their energy. Thankfully her Mom \n', 'had an idea for them. “Why don’t you start a club, and organize?” she suggested. \n', 'So Severn and four of her friends started the Environmental Children’s Organiza-\n', 'tion (ECO), to advocate for intergenerational environmental justice.\n', 'At age 12, Severn successfully raised enough funds to travel with ECO to \n', 'the 1992 UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – the very country that had \n', 'inspired her activism some years prior. ECO only planned to attend the summit as \n', 'spectators. But when one of the speakers dropped out, Severn saw an opportunity \n', 'to get the youth perspective on these issues out to the world. “We watched as all of \n', 'these old people were sitting around discussing the future; but we were the ones \n', 'who would be suffering from the consequences of their decisions,” Severn says. \n', '“Who was speaking for us?” So she stepped up, and showed unbelievable resolve \n', 'as she gave a powerful speech in front of many of the leading figures in the envi-\n', 'ronmental movement including now Secretary John Kerry, former Vice President \n', 'Al Gore and others. Seeds were planted then for environmental movements now.\n', 'A decade later, her speech became a viral sensation, called “The Girl Who \n', 'Silenced the World For 5 Minutes.” It reached more than 32 million people. \n', '“What was occurring, and what is still occurring, is that the people in power are \n', 'ignoring their sacred duty to preserve the world for their children,” she says. “It’s \n', 'amazing to see the world finally starting to wake up to the concept of intergener-\n', 'ational justice, after so many years. I’m proud of the young people, and ashamed \n', 'that it has taken us so long to get on board.”\n', 'After her speech, Severn was invited to sit on the Earth Charter Commission \n', 'and help draft guidelines on how people should be engaging with each other and \n', 'the planet in the 21st century. “We need an architecture for a different way of \n', 'being, and it should be intergenerational. Young people have always been on the \n', 'forefront of social change; they must be central to our guiding societal principles. \n', 'A lot of people have been advocating for these sorts of things since the 1980s - it \n', 'wasn’t ever just me. I was falling in line with a tradition of young people being \n', 'revolutionaries.”\n', 'In this tradition, Severn, along with Our Children’s Trust, has advised a \n', '417\n', 'group of 15 youth litigants from British Columbia, who are taking up the mantle. \n', 'In October 2019, La Rose vs Canada was brought to the Supreme Court to con-\n', 'tend that Canada has not been protecting the constitutional rights and liberties \n', 'of its young people, who are being unjustly impacted by the ramifications of our \n', 'environmental crisis. “It’s heartbreaking that it has been left to our kids to take \n', 'on this burden,” Severn says. “But it’s amazing to see the clarity and dedication \n', 'they have. It reignites that passion in me.” She, the David Suzuki Foundation, and \n', 'Ecojustice, are all supporting the case.\n', 'With so many new ways to connect digitally, and to create communities \n', 'through social media platforms, and with so many visible role models, Severn is \n', 'sure that youth movements will continue to grow. Still, she believes that getting \n', 'back to nature is necessary for the younger generation to gain a full appreciation \n', 'of the natural world. “As a parent, that was my main focus for my kids. We live \n', 'in an Indigenous community on an archipelago where the Haida have lived for \n', 'over 14,000 years. I wanted my kids to experience the way of life their ancestors \n', 'did. I wanted to ground them in their homeland. And now that they have that \n', 'connection, we can shift our focus to defend it – and defend the Earth at large.”\n', 'She also wants aspiring youth environmentalists to understand that a re-\n', 'imagined future isn’t something intangible or out of reach. In fact, she hopes the \n', 'movement will continue to support and understand the significance of Indigenous \n', 'people, who have practiced sustainable living throughout human history. “The \n', 'current way of life that we are experiencing is just one iteration of how a human \n', 'society can function. There are all kinds of examples of Indigenous civilizations, \n', 'past and present, that show us precisely how to live in harmony with the earth. \n', 'Indigenous people remain the most marginalized, displaced, and attacked peoples \n', 'around the world, yet they survive. There’s a lesson there, and understanding it \n', 'gets more urgent by the day. If mainstream society intends to do the same, it’s this \n', 'varied legacy of our Indigenous forebearers that we should be aspiring to going \n', 'forward.”\n', 'Though the obstacles we face as a global society are many, Severn is hopeful \n', 'for the future. Now Severn Cullis-Suzuki, married mother and a trained biologist, \n', 'she has seen how the information that’s been amassed over the years regarding \n', 'climate change is now irrefutable. This is reassuring, even though it has also made \n', 'clear the precariousness of our situation. “There’s no ambiguity about what we \n', 'need to do,” she says. “As a planet, we have to decarbonize, plain and simple.

I began to go to the gym to learn how to fight back and \n', 'defend myself.”\n', 'Thankfully, his parents recognized the seriousness of the situation, and \n', 'thought it wise to bring Arun to India to live with his grandfather, Mahatma \n', 'Gandhi. There the 12-year-old could learn from the great teacher himself, before \n', 'he let anger take control of his life.\n', 'Arun’s parents knew that the temptation to respond to prejudice with vio-\n', 'lence and anger had occurred in their family before. In fact, the great Mahatma \n', '419\n', 'himself had had a very similar experience early in his life.\n', 'As a young lawyer, Mahatma Gandhi had been the victim of racial prejudice \n', 'upon arriving in South Africa. He’d been thrown off the first-class car of a train, \n', 'since people of his color were banned from traveling first class. This humilia-\n', 'tion made him really angry. Initially he felt compelled to react to this treatment \n', 'with anger. However, before lashing out, he stopped himself, realizing that using \n', 'anger would only perpetuate a cycle of violence—and would ultimately turn \n', 'into something even worse. He vowed right then and there to dedicate his life \n', 'to doing whatever he could to stop this cycle of violence, beginning with himself. \n', 'And he famously went about creating a practice of using nonviolence to resolve  \n', 'sociopolitical and interpersonal conflicts.\n', 'He delved deeply into studying Ahimsa, the principle of nonviolence toward \n', 'all living things. Ahimsa is a central tenet of many eastern religions, found in the \n', 'ancient codes and texts of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Little did this angry \n', 'young man know that one day his life, and his message of the power of nonviolent \n', 'response to oppression would influence the world’s greatest civil rights leaders, \n', 'including Dr. Martin Luther King and Cesar Chavez—and would ultimately lead \n', 'to a massive improvement in the lives of millions of people around the world.\n', 'When Arun arrived in India, his grandfather shared the teachings of Ahimsa \n', 'with his grandson. And he talked to him openly about his own difficulties in con-\n', 'trolling his anger. “Ahimsa extends far beyond physical nonviolence; it must include \n', 'all forms of passive nonviolence,” Arun explains. “It doesn’t simply mean ‘Don’t \n', 'hit, don’t hurt, don’t kill, don’t harm.’ Ahimsa extends to the negative things we say \n', 'to one another. Our destructive actions. It even extends to our thinking, like the \n', 'negative patterns of thought we find ourselves in, or the anxieties we fixate upon.”\n', 'Arun’s grandfather told him to write every day in an anger journal, to help \n', 'him learn how to manage his anger and search for positive solutions. “This helped \n', 'me understand my anger, and learn how to channel the energy of anger into \n', 'something positive,” Arun says. “That’s the most powerful lesson he taught me: to \n', 'use the energy constructively, rather than destructively.”\n', 'Arun sees an analogy between the power of anger, and the power of elec-\n', 'tricity. “It’s just as useful, and just as powerful, but only if we use it intelligently,” \n', 'he says. “It can be just as destructive too: so we must channel this energy to be in \n', 'service of the good of humanity.” He pauses, then adds, “I believe this type of \n', 'training should be compulsory education for young people. So much pain and \n', 'violence in the world could be avoided if youth understood how to channel their \n', 'anger.”\n', ' 420\n', 'Arun fondly remembers walking by his grandfather’s side as they traveled \n', 'through the villages of India. There he could sense the greatness of this man \n', 'he called Grandfather. After dinner each night he had a nightly practice of  \n', 'self-analysis with his grandfather. “He made me draw a genealogical tree of vi-\n', 'olence, like a family tree. In the tree, violence was a grandparent, and physical \n', 'violence and passive violence were the two offspring.”\n', 'Every night before Arun went to bed, he would do this self-analysis, think-\n', 'ing about what had made him angry during the day, and putting it on the tree. \n', '“Physical violence we know about and understand. We see it and we can see that \n', 'it hurts,” he says. “Yet we don’t think about passive violence when we are young. \n', 'There are many things we do that we just don’t think of as being violent. Any-\n', 'thing we do that hurts somebody or something, directly or indirectly, is violence. \n', 'Hoarding resources. Overconsumption, when so many are going hungry. And of \n', 'course, the way we treat the natural world around us; the environment.” He adds, \n', '“All this analysis made me realize that passive violence fuels physical violence; so \n', 'we must cut off the fuel supply, which comes from each one of us. It is just as my \n', 'grandfather said: we must be the change we want to see in the world.”\n', 'Mahatma Gandhi was one of the first to recognize the dangers of the global \n', 'climate situation. He spoke out against violence against nature in all its forms. He \n', 'stressed that when we don’t live in harmony with the natural world, it’s inevitable \n', 'that we will destroy nature – and ourselves. For today’s youth leaders in the envi-\n', 'ronmental movement, Arun believes that his grandfather’s message would be the \n', 'same.\n', '“My grandfather always tried to convince people to bring about a change,” \n', 'he says. “Our leaders preach, but they don’t practice. If we want to seriously deal \n', 'with the climate situation and get the people of the world to stand hand in hand, \n', 'the leading countries must follow their own advice. Even children learn more \n', 'from what they see than what they hear. It’s the same message for adults in this \n', 'movement, who are working either on their own efforts, or in support of their \n', 'children: you must live what you want others to learn.”\n', 'As a self-described “peace farmer,” Arun has taught countless numbers of \n', 'people over the years how to abide by the principles of Ahimsa. In 1987 he and \n', 'his beloved wife Sunanda were invited by the University of Mississippi to study \n', 'racial prejudice in South Africa, India, and the U.S. Then in 1991 they founded \n', 'The M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence. They spent decades traveling back \n', 'to India to work with orphanages and homelessness there.\n', 'Over the years Arun has been increasingly troubled by the destruction of \n', '421\n', 'the environment, in both South Africa and India. In impoverished communities, \n', 'he was disturbed seeing mining operations with little or no regulation, and heavy \n', 'deforestation. Wherever he goes, the main thread he sees linking this destruction \n', 'of the environment is poverty.\n', '“Everywhere I go I see the same thing. Wherever there is poverty, there is \n', 'more pollution. If we don’t eradicate poverty in the world, we won’t be able to \n', 'stop this environmental degradation. Millions of people in India and Africa live \n', 'in such poverty that they are forced to use up any resource they can just to survive. \n', 'Miners wear out their land to sell coal and oil to rich countries. When they don’t \n', 'have the money for cooking or heating oil, people go into the forest, and chop \n', 'down trees to use as fuel. When the forest gets used up, they must burn things \n', 'like plastics and garbage to keep themselves alive in winter, and this causes mas-\n', 'sive amounts of pollution.” He pauses, and sighs. Then he adds, “This sort of \n', 'problem can’t be addressed without addressing poverty. Unless desperately poor \n', 'people have an alternative, we can’t really save the environment. There has to be a  \n', 'balance between materialism and morality.”\n', 'Arun’s global travels have caused him to focus his energy on compassion as \n', 'a necessary part of any healing.\n', '“Some of the most devastating social problems in the world, like homeless-\n', 'ness and poverty, can’t be solved by government. Government does not have the \n', 'capacity to deal with the issue of compassion. Simply pouring money into an issue \n', 'does not eradicate it. It can only be solved by rebuilding self-respect and self-con-\n', 'fidence in people – and that can only be done by people like you and me,” he says. \n', 'But he adds that those who are attempting to help need to maintain a sense of \n', 'humility. “We must listen to the people with these problems. Sit with them, talk \n', 'with them, and try to understand from their perspective how their problems can \n', 'best be resolved. This is what nonviolence teaches us: humility, and compassion, \n', 'and love. And understanding.”\n', 'Today, 86 years old, Arun is still inspiring people. After his beloved wife \n', 'passed, he moved to Rochester, New York to be near his daughter and her family. \n', 'He is often invited to lecture and talk to people, and to write about climate change \n', 'and nonviolence.

Growing \n', 'up, she and her family lived a simple life in the little village of Mantenópolis, Bra-\n', 'zil. As she walked past her grandmother’s house, she loved smelling the luscious \n', 'mangoes that she grew in big pots on her porch. “Everything we ate was organic \n', 'and seasonal,” she says. “When it was mango season, we ate mangoes. When it \n', 'was banana season, we ate bananas.”\n', 'However, with Brazil’s economy in tatters, there were few jobs. Life was \n', 'hard. Try as they might, it was tough for her parents to make ends meet. Often \n', 'Taynara’s family went without much food. For years, her parents saved every pen-\n', 'ny they could so they could search for a better life for their little family. And every \n', 'night they prayed together.\n', 'People in the village talked about the island of Martha’s Vineyard off the \n', 'coast of Massachusetts. A few local men had traveled the 5,000 miles there, and \n', 'found jobs building big homes for wealthy summer families. During the cold win-\n', 'ter months, they’d return home and work on building their own homes. Since \n', 'Taynara’s father was a carpenter, he was eager to see if he might find a good job \n', 'there too, so he could provide for his family.\n', 'In December 2001, they left Brazil with just a few things, filled with hope \n', 'for their future. As they boarded the plane, 3-year-old Taynara held her mother’s \n', 'hand and looked up at her. “Does this mean I’ll get to go to college and become \n', 'a doctor?” she asked. Her mother smiled and said, “This means a lot of things if \n', 'you are willing to try your hardest.”\n', 'When they arrived, they were one of the very first Brazilian families to live \n', 'on Martha’s Vineyard. Life wasn’t easy, especially in the winter. This little island \n', 'had a tight-knit community of 20,000 year-rounders. They struggled in the long \n', 'winter months to eke out a living. During the summer months, the island swelled \n', ' 434\n', 'to 100,000 people, including service workers from Ireland and Jamaica, who \n', 'worked in the hotels. Then, after the summer, everyone went home. So, when \n', 'Brazilians began to arrive with their whole families and to stay—and send their \n', 'children to school—local people were nervous. They didn’t think there would be \n', 'enough to go around, especially in the winter months. Taynara remembers how \n', 'it hurt when she saw how people looked down on her parents when they heard \n', 'their accents.\n', 'Taynara’s mother was relieved to discover that Elio Silva had opened a little \n', 'shop with Brazilian foods, including the chocolate Caixa de Bombons that her \n', 'father had bought her for special occasions. By the time twenty years had passed, \n', 'there were several restaurants catering to the more than 2,000 Brazilians who now \n', 'live year-round on the island. And Brazilian youth strengthened the high school’s \n', 'soccer team, which won the coveted statewide championships.\n', 'But on her first day of kindergarten at the Oak Bluffs School, Taynara could \n', 'feel everyone’s eyes on her. There was only one other Brazilian child in her class. \n', 'Taynara only knew four words in English: “Hi, how are you?” But with her warm \n', 'smile, sparkling eyes, and gentle ways, she made friends. She practiced her English \n', 'and picked up words watching movies on TV. To this day, Taynara greets every-\n', 'one with this same message—and with the same intention. She sincerely wants to \n', 'know how you are—which makes you want to respond in kind.\n', 'School wasn’t easy for Taynara, but she pushed herself, studied hard, and al-\n', 'ways got good grades. “I constantly reminded myself that this was my big chance \n', 'to achieve my dream,” she says. “Whenever I was discouraged I reminded myself \n', 'how lucky I was to be here and to have this opportunity.” In high school, she was \n', 'proud to be invited to join the National Honor Society. Step by step, with laser \n', 'focus, and along with her daily prayers, Taynara pursued her dream of becoming \n', 'a doctor.\n', 'Then one day her teacher nominated Taynara to be a youth delegate to the \n', 'Martha’s Vineyard Youth Leadership Initiative (MVYLI). When she arrived at \n', 'the orientation, she was surprised to see that the codirector of the Summit, Josue \n', 'Cruz, was from the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico. Josue had been just 14 years \n', 'old when he went to his first Summit in Vieques. Now in college, he was pursuing \n', 'his dream of becoming a lawyer. “It was amazing to listen to Josue; he had faced \n', 'struggles, but he wasn’t defined by them. He persevered,” Taynara says. “I knew \n', 'then that I wasn’t alone. That I can do this too!”\n', 'On the first day of the Summit, Taynara was fascinated to meet so many \n', 'multicultural young people from islands like Vieques, Virgin Gorda, and Hawaii. \n', '435\n', 'Taynara felt that she had a new family of friends who were all ready to support \n', 'her in realizing her goal. “It’s awesome!” she says. “It gives you another family, a \n', 'safe place to talk about important things—and to bring back to your school setting \n', 'too.”\n', 'At the Summit Taynara developed a greater awareness about climate change \n', 'and sustainability. On tours they took to the Vineyard farms, she saw different \n', 'crops than those she’d known in Brazil. She saw firsthand how climate change \n', 'was contributing to coastal erosion. Waterfront homes were being threatened, and \n', 'the frequent flooding of the Four Corners intersection by the ferry held up traffic \n', 'for hours.\n', 'A few years later, Taynara visited her family’s village in Brazil. “It was culture \n', 'shock,” she says. “Somehow it didn’t feel real. It’s a whole different world. Some-\n', 'times I wonder what my life would have been like if I’d stayed.” During that visit \n', 'she realized that climate change was taking a toll on her family’s village. Extreme \n', 'weather—first dryness from the lack of rain, and then torrential downpours—was \n', 'washing away the precious rich topsoil so important for farming their crops.\n', 'As the first in her family to go to college, Taynara was excited and nervous. \n', 'Her high school guidance counselor had discouraged Taynara from applying to a \n', 'four-year college. “That’s too much for you,” he said, and directed her instead to \n', 'a community college. But Taynara knew that she’d never become a doctor unless \n', 'she started at a four-year college. “I was a good student, involved with extracurric-\n', 'ular activities, just like the other students,” she says. “Why shouldn’t I be able to \n', 'pursue my dream?” She walked out the door, never to return. It was the first time \n', 'that she had felt the sting of institutional racism.\n', 'But in MVYLI’s college prep program, she got the help she needed: tutoring \n', 'for the SATs and help for her parents in filling out the financial aid forms. She \n', 'enjoyed visiting a few different colleges to see which one might be best for her. \n', 'However, as a “Dreamer” Taynara knew that she wouldn’t qualify for scholarships. \n', 'Her parents couldn’t help her either. Fortunately, the Institute found a benefactor \n', 'who offered to sponsor Taynara’s education. It was the answer to her prayers!\n', 'Taynara’s dream of becoming a doctor continued to be shaped with MVY-\n', 'LI’s Job Shadow Day. Each year she spent an afternoon with one of the island’s \n', 'doctors: she shadowed family physicians, pediatricians, doctors at the health clinic, \n', 'and eventually in the hospital’s emergency room. She loved it! Each time her \n', 'dream was renewed, even as she refined her goals. Thanks to her mentors, Tay-\n', 'nara was able to see the wealth of career opportunities for premed students, and \n', 'her horizons expanded.\n', ' 436\n', 'For her MVYLI Sustainability-in-Action project, Taynara worked with \n', 'other multicultural youth to envision and create the Institute’s Multicultural \n', 'Assembly at the Martha’s Vineyard Regional High School. “Hi, I’m Charlayne \n', 'Hunter-Gault, and I’m multicultural,” said the honored speaker when the day \n', 'came. “We are standing on the shoulders of giants,” she continued, quoting from \n', 'President Obama’s Inaugural speech. “I am, they were, you are where you are \n', 'because we are standing on the shoulders of giants.” Then high school senior \n', 'Jacob Lawrence spoke of his African American heritage, with roots in Ghana and \n', 'Nigeria. “Thirty percent of the MVRHS students are multicultural,” he told the \n', 'assembled students. “Take time to get to know your friends.” Then Ana Carvalho \n', 'shared her experience of being a Brazilian student at MVRHS in 2008. “When \n', 'I was a student, there was a lot of tension,” she admitted. Now a senior at Tufts \n', 'University, she invited the students to be open to each other. “I hope you will learn \n', 'to appreciate Brazilian culture. Your Brazilian peers have a lot to offer.”\n', 'For the next Summit Taynara served as a “Visioneer,” warmly welcoming \n', 'the new youth delegates as they arrived. All through college, Taynara worked with \n', 'Brazilian youth on Martha’s Vineyard, encouraging them to pursue their dreams \n', 'too. She now serves as a Facilitator at each Summit, training young people with \n', 'the tools they need to pursue their dreams for their lives, their communities, and \n', 'the world. She enjoyed working with the Institute’s other Facilitators like Kassan-\n', 'dra Cruz from Vieques, Puerto Rico, Namgyal Gyaltshen from Bhutan, Berta \n', 'Pelaez from Guatemala and Patricia Pires Dias from Cape Verdes. “I love to get \n', 'to know people that are multicultural,” Taynara says. “Each person has a different \n', 'story, and each one of them will impact you in a different way. This island is filled \n', 'with multicultural people, even though not everyone knows it. We are all a big \n', 'family, filled with amazing stories to share with one another.”\n', 'Now a 23-year-old college graduate, Taynara was thrilled to get her dream \n', 'job as a medical assistant and health educator at Island Health Care on the Vine-\n', 'yard. “I feel really blessed to be doing what I love, helping people, especially during \n', 'the pandemic, when so many of my classmates are struggling to find any kind of \n', 'job.” When the new U.S. Congress passed the Dreamers Act, Taynara knew it \n', 'was in answer to her prayers. Now she can finally dream again—this time to go to \n', 'medical school—and finally realize her dream of becoming a doctor. “I’ve been \n', 'praying for this for a very long time,” she says. “And now?

For the summer \n', 'people, celebrities, and even presidents, the Vineyard is a beautiful place to spend \n', 'leisurely time with their families and meet old friends.\n', 'But for 16-year-old Chris, this year felt different. It was the first day of the \n', 'Stone Soup Leadership Institute’s Sustainability Summit on Martha’s Vineyard. \n', 'Young people from across the country had gathered together at a large up-island \n', 'hilltop home overlooking Menemsha Pond. They had all been nominated by their \n', 'communities to serve as delegates at the Summit, to learn how to become leaders \n', 'of a more sustainable world.\n', 'After their morning ice-breakers, the very first speaker was Arun Gand-\n', 'hi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi. All the youth were spellbound as he spoke. \n', 'They’d often heard the phrase “Be the change you want to see in the world,” and \n', 'Arun was the embodiment of this powerful message. As Chris listened to him tell \n', 'the story of his grandfather, he was transported to a little village in India. “Can \n', 'you imagine being 12 years old and getting this powerful lesson from your grand-\n', 'father, Mahatma Gandhi?” he thought. The anecdote Arun told had a very simple \n', 'message about sustainability embedded in it: it was about the importance of not \n', ' 438\n', 'throwing away a pencil until the very end.\n', 'It was the quality of the people Chris met at this week-long intensive Sum-\n', 'mit that touched him the most. He fondly remembers playing football on the large \n', 'lawn with Trevor and Elijah. This became the start of a very special friendship. \n', 'Chris was impressed that the Hawaiian delegates had collected native tea leaves \n', 'from their homeland to bring 6,000 miles to the Summit. As they taught him how \n', 'to make Hawaiian leis, they shared stories of their culture, their language, and \n', 'their world. Thanks to these young people and their aloha spirit, Chris came to \n', 'understand the concept of sustainability in a whole new light.\n', 'At that Summit, Arun Gandhi asked the Institute to bring its transformative \n', 'educational tools to the young people of India. Curious by nature, and a self-\n', 'taught techie, Chris offered to help with this ambitious challenge. He had already \n', 'won many awards, and had designed software and apps. While many of his class-\n', 'mates saw the technology career path as a ticket to a high-paying job, Chris was \n', 'more intrigued with the idea of being able to use the power of technology for \n', 'positive social change. His father, a longtime teacher at the Vineyard’s high school \n', 'had always encouraged his son to think outside the box. Now, empowered by what \n', 'he had learned at the Summit, Chris was inspired to ground his ideals in serving \n', 'humanity. He wasn’t quite sure how this was going to happen, but he was willing \n', 'to try.\n', 'That summer, while tourists and seasonal residents were vacationing, Chris \n', 'joined the Institute’s intergenerational team to dive into this very challenging task. \n', 'Their goal was to envision a way to transfer 20 years of the Institute’s trainings \n', 'and educational tools to an online platform. First Chris looked at digital courses \n', 'like Coursera and edX. “Too traditional,” he decided. Next the team decided \n', 'to use the Design Thinking approach, asking themselves the key question “How \n', 'might we?....” to brainstorm ideas. Then Chris had a thought—last summer he’d \n', 'attended a Hack-a-Thon, where college-aged students immersed themselves \n', 'for 24 hours to design innovative tech apps and software. “There’s never been a \n', 'Hack-a-Thon on the Vineyard,” Chris said. “Let’s do it!”\n', 'Chris thought it was a pretty simple idea. Little did he know what he was \n', 'about to embark on. Reaching out to college students and inviting them to give of \n', 'their time, and then travel all the way to the Vineyard by car, bus, and ferry took \n', 'some doing. But they came! They came from Amherst College, Hampshire Col-\n', 'lege, Mt. Holyoke College, and from the University of Massachusetts in Lowell. \n', 'Later they said that the idea of responding to Gandhi’s grandson’s challenge had \n', 'intrigued them.\n', '439\n', 'Finding a home large enough to house this crew was quite an undertaking. \n', 'It was now late November, and most large homes on the Vineyard aren’t insulated. \n', 'By luck, perseverance, and ultimately maybe even divine intervention, the owner \n', 'of a 20-room Victorian mansion, inspired by the Institute’s mission, offered her \n', 'home. Overlooking Inkwell Beach in Oak Bluffs, the Villa Rosa was once owned \n', 'by Joe Overton, a political organizer and the first head of a labor union in New \n', 'York City. His home had served as the Summer White House, and leaders and \n', 'organizers of the Civil Rights movement, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \n', 'had stayed here. It was here, looking out over the vast horizon of the Atlantic \n', 'Ocean, that Dr. King is said to have written his famous “I Have A Dream” speech.\n', 'The Design-A-Thon, as it was called, began with a sumptuous feast, with the \n', 'owner of the house sharing stories about its history. Then everyone jumped into \n', 'the immersive 24-hour experience. After the Institute’s team gave an overview of \n', 'their vision and goals, the visiting techies interviewed the Institute’s youth leaders \n', 'as well as the facilitators of the Summit to create a “user profile.” Then everyone \n', 'retired to their separate nooks to work on coding. They chose the attic as their hub, \n', 'and set up the large screen where they could showcase their progress. All through \n', 'the night they worked, sustained with lots of coffee, pizza, and junk food. It was \n', 'an exhilarating time. As the youngest person there, Chris loved hanging out with \n', 'these seasoned techies in the kitchen during their breaks and hearing them talk \n', 'about user-design, prototypes, beta testing, and the ultimate goal: user-friendly.\n', 'A videographer documented the process, and interviewed Chris and youth \n', 'leaders like Josue Cruz from Vieques, Puerto Rico and Alex Siordia from Hawaii. \n', '“This house is the right place to do this,” Chris said. “I feel that in some ways what \n', 'we are doing has a relation to what Dr. King was trying to do. Creating change \n', 'and inspiring people to challenge the status quo, and how to be leaders. You can \n', 'feel Dr. King’s presence here. That what you are doing has a bigger purpose than \n', 'just a computer program. I really feel that it can go somewhere.”\n', 'In just 24 hours, the band of techies had created an impressive “pitch deck” \n', 'presentation to present to potential funders. When it came time for the Reveal \n', 'Event, Chris made the presentation to the Island’s business and education leaders. \n', 'He was pretty proud of what everyone had accomplished. “It was a really good \n', 'feeling,” he says. “It was the first time I’d had the experience of having a big \n', 'idea, and helping to make it actually happen! To this very day, seven years later, \n', 'every time I drive by that house, I tell the story of this life-changing experience to \n', 'whomever is in the car.”\n', 'That fall, as a junior in high school, Chris convinced his advisor that he \n', ' 440\n', 'should get credit to pursue this project as an independent study. Then he joined \n', 'with the Institute’s facilitators, Gia Winsryg-Ulmer and Grace Burton Sundman, \n', 'to design a leadership course using the Institute’s curriculum. Offered to the Mar-\n', 'tha’s Vineyard Youth Leadership Initiative (MVYLI) youth, this 10-week pilot \n', 'program became the beta site for the Institute’s TouchStone Leaders Platform. “I \n', 'learned that it’s best to not sit back and overthink a great idea,” Chris says now. \n', '“If you have an idea that you think would make a difference in your life, your \n', 'community’s life, or anyone’s life, you should go through with it and act on it in \n', 'a timely manner.” Chris was convinced that his high school should incorporate \n', 'this pilot into their leadership class. “We should share it with others so they can \n', 'have an opportunity to learn the necessary leadership skills for life. This program \n', 'teaches many skills not found in the classroom.”\n', 'To continue his exploration into the tech world, Chris was matched with a \n', 'business leader, John Klein, for MVYLI’s Job Shadow Day. And the following year, \n', 'he was matched with virtual reality pioneer Galen Ho. As they explored Galen’s \n', 'state-of-the-art Immersive Worlds, Galen listened to Chris’s dreams for his future, \n', 'and encouraged him to apply to the little-known Olin College of Engineering, just \n', 'outside of Boston. When Chris received a full scholarship to study there, Chris’s \n', 'father was thrilled. He had attended Northeastern University, but had had to \n', 'drop out and get a job before he could complete his education. He knew what a \n', 'difference it would make for his son to graduate debt-free from college.\n', 'At the next Summit, Chris was a freshman at Olin College of Engineering. \n', 'He was thrilled to see Trevor again, who was now a senior in college. Chris espe-\n', 'cially enjoyed rooming with Trevor and sharing lodgings with the younger male \n', 'delegates at the Summit. “They were so full of energy, so funny, and eager to hear \n', 'about my experiences at college,” Chris says. “I was happy to be able to be a true \n', 'mentor to these high school youth. It was a good feeling.”\n', 'For the past few years Trevor had worked with the Institute to design strate-\n', 'gies to bring sustainability education to public school students. He was also search-\n', 'ing for ways to use technology to help youth get jobs in the emerging field of \n', 'sustainability. Chris was happy to help Trevor with this new challenge. Along with \n', 'the Institute’s tech advisor, Chris and Trevor once again dived into the question \n', '“How might we...?” “Let’s create a new site,” Chris said. He quickly searched \n', 'for available ones. “Sustainability is Fun is available,” he said, “Shall we grab it? \n', 'What a great name - kids will love it!”\n', 'Throughout the following year, Chris worked virtually with Trevor and the \n', 'Institute’s team to create the new site so that it could be tested with youth at the \n', '441\n', 'next Summit. Then he brought his college roommate, Ilya, to the next summit, \n', 'which was held in Newport, Rhode Island. With Trevor as their guide, they en-\n', 'visioned an online ecosystem that connects youth, educators, and companies to \n', 'build sustainable economies.\n', 'They’d also made plans to create a Design-A-Thon to be held just before the \n', 'Summit. This time it was with business, education, and government leaders of the \n', 'Blue Economy in southern New England.\n', 'They designed surveys, gathered data, and facilitated an engaging user-de-\n', 'sign experience with these industry leaders. With Trevor as their guide for the \n', 'week-long event, they drilled down on the data and designed a presentation for \n', 'the Summit about the Sustainable Workforce Development Network: Sustain-\n', 'WDNTM.\n', '“It was truly a pleasure to meet our next generation of leaders at the De-\n', 'sign-A-Thon,” says Robert Rak, of Bristol Community College’s Blue Center. “It \n', 'was inspiring to see these young people actively engaging in the development of \n', 'meaningful communication with business leaders. They were not only seeking \n', 'information for themselves, but also for the youth of today as a whole. Bringing \n', 'together the many players in this emerging Blue Economy is very important so \n', 'that we can work together, as a team, to bring a bright future to our region and \n', 'the nation as a whole.”\n', 'Just before Chris graduated from college, his beloved father passed.

And they celebrated enthusiastically with her when she \n', 'won third prize!\n', 'The next year for VYLI’s Job Shadow Day, Kassandra was matched with \n', 'Ileana Cambó, a former Ms. Puerto Rico and the VP at L’Oréal. That led to her \n', 'first photo shoot and the beginning of her professional portfolio. At fundraising \n', 'events, like VYLI’s Taste of the Island, she was introduced to other leaders of the \n', 'fashion industry. And from there, her modeling career skyrocketed! In just three \n', 'years, she became a top model for UNICA, the #1 modeling agency in Puerto \n', 'Rico, and was being featured on fashion magazine covers and receiving many \n', 'awards.\n', 'However, Kassandra was not naïve; she saw the dark side of the fashion \n', 'industry, which glorified prepubescent girls and often took advantage of their \n', 'vulnerability. Wise beyond her years, Kassandra kept her head on her shoulders, \n', 'and stay focused on her goals. She knew that modeling wasn’t a life for her, just a \n', 'stepping stone from which to pursue her bigger dreams.\n', 'Because she had achieved her first dream, to be a top fashion model, she \n', 'was an inspiring role model for young girls on Vieques. She led workshops and \n', 'provided guidance for aspiring models, organized professional photo shoots and \n', 'fashion shows for them, and led college prep workshops to encourage local youth \n', ' 444\n', 'to strive toward higher education. With VYLI’s Entrepreneurship Initiative, she \n', 'also led workshops where young people turned local natural resources—seeds, \n', 'beads, shells, glass, and stone—into unique jewelry. On the weekends, they sold \n', 'their wares to tourists and raised funds to invest in their initiative. They were \n', 'thrilled when they were invited to be the youngest representatives at the 3rd An-\n', 'nual Caribbean Artisan Festival in the British Virgin Islands and were able to fly \n', 'for the first time, to the neighboring island of Tortola, where they met artisans \n', 'from ten different Caribbean countries, as well as entrepreneurs and re-foresters \n', 'who were preserving their traditional cultures as well as their island environments.\n', 'Kassandra carefully saved the money she was earning from modeling so \n', 'that one day she would be the first in her family to go to college, an even more \n', 'important dream come true. At the Inter American University in Puerto Rico, \n', 'she received her degree in Business Administration. And she spent a semester \n', 'abroad at the Spain Business School in Barcelona, studying swimwear design at \n', 'the Centro de Las Artes del Diseño y la Alta Costura.\n', 'In 2012 Kassandra continued to expand her horizons by traveling to Mar-\n', 'tha’s Vineyard to share her experiences at the Stone Soup Leadership Institute’s \n', 'Sustainability Summit. And she traveled to the tiny island of Lanai, Hawaii and \n', 'then the Puerto Rican community of Holyoke in western Massachusetts to show \n', 'young people how they could use their entrepreneurial skills to realize their dreams.\n', 'The next year Kassandra moved to Boston and became the first employee \n', 'for a startup sustainable fashion company, Rebag (Trendlee. com). In 2014, when \n', 'the company expanded and moved to the U.S. fashion capitol of New York City, \n', 'Kassandra moved with them. Rebag is now a $50 million luxury resale retailer \n', 'that buys and sells luxury handbags. As its Head of Operations, Kassandra over-\n', 'sees teams of 20 people based in branches all over the world.\n', 'Rebag allows customers to refresh their closets as often as they like and \n', 'choose from a selection of thousands of designer handbags. “You can purchase \n', 'a bag, carry it for up to six months, exchange it for Rebag credit worth at least \n', '70 percent of the original purchase price, and put the credit toward a new bag,” \n', 'Kassandra explains. During the COVID pandemic, the company launched a re-\n', 'sourceful new app, “Clair AI,” that allows customers to instantly determine the \n', 'value of new and pre- owned luxury handbags and purchase remotely. “And you \n', 'haven’t had to directly interact with anyone to make it happen,” she says. “We \n', 'get to give these bags three to five ‘homes’ during their lifetime instead of having \n', 'them end up in the trash after just one season,” Kassandra says, as she reflects \n', 'back on the Christian Dior bag she found in the trash as a 12-year-old. “That bag \n', '445\n', 'is still very popular,” she says. “And it is worth $3,800!”\n', 'Kassandra is proud to be working in the sustainable fashion industry, along \n', 'with companies like Poshmark and ThredUp. She’s pleased to see that some large \n', 'companies, like Levi Strauss, are adopting more sustainable practices too, and she \n', 'keeps a discerning and watchful eye on the way sustainability practices are defined \n', 'and applied in the industry.\n', 'When in 2017 Hurricane Maria devastated all of Puerto Rico, it brought \n', 'Vieques to its knees. The island’s famous Bioluminescent Bay was destroyed, along \n', 'with its rich mangrove ecosystem. Without ferry service, people were without food \n', 'and gas; and the environmental toxins left behind by the U.S. Navy had left peo-\n', 'ple vulnerable to scary autoimmune illnesses. Without a hospital on the island, \n', 'many people died, especially the elderly—including Kassandra’s beloved abuela. \n', 'Kassandra did what she could to help her family, raising funds and sending them \n', 'to her mother, and offering her sisters and their children shelter in her tiny Man-\n', 'hattan apartment.\n', 'But people on Vieques are survivors, and they are resilient. They have ral-\n', 'lied, and together they are slowly rebuilding their island.\n', 'During the pandemic, Kassandra has continued to work with Rebag remote-\n', 'ly, which gave her the chance to return to her homeland so her new son, Thiago, \n', 'could spend time with her family. She loves seeing that the spirit of Vieques is \n', 'still strong. She’s especially inspired by how young people are leading the way \n', 'with organizations like La Coleman Cimarrone, creating community gardens and \n', 'big composting and recycling projects, as well as ecotourism companies that offer \n', 'hiking and other island adventures. “It’s refreshing,” she says. She’s glad to see \n', 'that people on Vieques are striving to become more self-sufficient by growing their \n', 'own foods and creating renewable energy projects. And she’s especially glad to see \n', 'that they are working together to improve life for everyone on the island.

His \n', 'friend, Carmianne, had invited him to join her for a Youth Leadership Summit on \n', 'their little island of Vieques, Puerto Rico. At first Josue was concerned he’d have \n', 'to take a week off from his job at the local pizza shop. At 14 years old, this young \n', 'man felt responsible for helping his family, who were barely surviving on welfare \n', 'and food stamps.\n', 'Times were tough. When the U.S. Navy arrived 68 years ago, they had sup-\n', 'pressed the island’s economy: they told everyone to either leave or sign up for \n', 'government aid. For three generations, people weren’t able to even have a job. \n', 'Now that the Navy had finally left, everyone was hopeful for a better future. Ever \n', 'since Josue could remember, he’d heard the bombs exploding, testing the worst \n', 'weapons for wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq. People tried to stop them \n', 'with peaceful protests and civil disobedience, even putting their bodies on the run-\n', 'way so planes couldn’t refuel. Over and over again they were arrested. Sometimes \n', 'celebrities, like Edward James Olmos, joined them, to get the media’s attention. \n', 'The famous actor had even been the mayor’s cellmate in jail.\n', 'The mayor of Vieques invited the Stone Soup Leadership Institute to help \n', '447\n', 'train the island’s youth for a better future. On the first day of the Institute’s Sum-\n', 'mit, Josue watched the beloved actor share a video message to Vieques youth.\n', 'You’ve been chosen to be here as part of the Youth Leadership Summit. This is much \n', 'needed not only in Vieques, and Puerto Rico but on the entire planet. You are the \n', 'hope of the future. The future depends on all of you sitting listening to me today. I \n', 'wish I could be with you there, and inspire you, as you would inspire me. Really, we \n', 'belong together. Thank you for being here today to become the leaders we need you to \n', 'be. God bless you and thank you all.\n', 'Josue arrived early to the Summit, eager to check things out. When he saw \n', 'the Institute’s organizers setting up, he asked, “How can I help?” Josue was hon-\n', 'ored to be asked to hang a poster of his heroes: Gandhi, Dr. King, Cesar Chavez, \n', 'and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Thus began Josue’s life-changing journey: it \n', 'would end up transforming his life, and many other lives too.\n', 'To begin the Summit, Native American Nane Alejandrez from Barrios Uni-\n', 'dos in California led the youth in ceremonial chanting at the ancient site where \n', 'a medicine man’s 4,000-year-old bones had just been discovered. He asked for \n', 'prayers for the young people to have the courage to lead their island to a better \n', 'future for all their people.\n', '“What is your dream for your life, for your island, and for the world?” For the first time, \n', 'Josue was being encouraged to dream big. “My dream for my life is to become \n', 'a lawyer,” he said, determined. “For my island: to be the Mayor. For my world: \n', 'Peace.” Josue was passionate about giving young people the opportunity to better \n', 'their lives. Every day he could see how Americans were coming to invest in his \n', 'island - buying real estate, starting restaurants and setting up B&Bs and hotels. \n', 'Tourism was booming. More than anything Josue wanted his people to reap the \n', 'benefits of their hard-won victory and earn a good living to provide for their \n', 'families.\n', 'For the next four years, Josue worked tirelessly to cofound the Vieques Youth \n', 'Leadership Initiative. He was impressed that rock star Tito Auger continued to \n', 'keep his promise to help Vieques. During the years of peaceful protests, Tito’s \n', '“Song of Vieques” had been their anthem. Vieques youth were excited that Tito \n', 'traveled from San Juan to Vieques to work with the Institute’s team to develop \n', 'the Cultural Arts & Entrepreneurship Initiative. They created a logo, a theme \n', 'song, and a photographic display of their faces with their dreams. Everyone was \n', 'so proud to see it hanging in the Vieques Airport so those who visited would \n', 'see them as Vieques’s future leaders. During weekly workshops, Taino artisans \n', 'trained youth to make hand-crafted jewelry, climb trees to collect calabash, and \n', ' 448\n', 'carve Indigenous designs for unique lampshades. On the weekends, they set up a \n', 'table on the Malecon and sold their wares to tourists. They practiced their English \n', 'and developed math and money management skills. One winter they raised over \n', '$4,000.\n', 'More than anything, Josue knew that if his people were to succeed in this \n', 'new economy, they needed to learn English. To protest the Navy occupation, \n', 'teachers had refused to teach their students English. So now there were three \n', 'generations of families who spoke only Spanish. Vieques was very isolated from \n', 'Puerto Rico and the world. There was only one wi-fi hotspot on the whole island. \n', 'With just a few computers, the paying tourists got first dibs. But lucky for Josue, \n', 'Island Computers was right across the street from his home. The owner was kind \n', 'and offered to help. With the Institute’s support, they applied for a Microsoft grant \n', 'for the first computer training on the island. First, Josue had to make his case to \n', 'justify the request. From piles of papers stacked on the floors of government offic-\n', 'es, he collected statistics to develop the report, “The Challenges Facing Vieques \n', 'Youth.” When the grant was received, this 16-year-old was the program’s first \n', 'trainer. Josue felt a deep sense of pride training his people to learn computer skills \n', 'and explore the power of the World Wide Web.\n', 'Vieques had a long way to go to catch up. Josue was on a quest, searching \n', 'for ideas, eager to discover best practices from other island communities. As the \n', 'youngest person at the Caribbean Media Exchange conference in San Juan, he \n', 'met San Juan’s top meteorologist. She was surprised to meet such an inquisitive \n', 'young man asking serious questions about climate change and how it might affect \n', 'his island. Josue was fascinated by her presentation, with scientific facts and a \n', 'declaration from 70 prominent scientists calling for a moratorium on building on \n', 'Puerto Rico’s fragile coastline.\n', 'Later that year, when it rained 24 inches in 24 hours Josue remembered the \n', 'meteorologist’s message. He realized then that he needed to find ways to help his \n', 'people prepare for natural disasters. He set up one of the first Facebook groups \n', 'to map where families, especially the elderly, lived. He wanted to be sure they \n', 'weren’t forgotten if - and when - future disasters hit again. Little did he know how \n', 'prophetic this would be when in 2017 Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico. \n', 'Vieques was at the eye of that storm.\n', 'Josue continued his travels, next to Los Angeles. At the next Youth Lead-\n', 'ership Summit on Vieques, he had met the grandson and namesake of the great \n', 'Latino leader, Cesar Chavez. He’d read about his leadership for the farmworkers \n', 'in California. Josue was happy to translate for Cesar and bring his inspiring mes-\n', '449\n', 'sage of hope to Vieques youth. So, when Cesar invited Josue to visit him in Los \n', 'Angeles, he jumped at the chance. Within a few short months, he visited Cesar \n', 'Chavez’s burial place, La Paz and his Radio Campesina, where he was a featured \n', 'guest speaker. Cesar taught Josue how to create a website to share VYLI’s message \n', 'with the world. Upon his return, Josue created his own radio show, where he \n', 'featured local experts to share their vision for Vieques’s future.\n', 'Everyone on Vieques longed to see the world. So, when Josue returned from \n', 'Los Angeles, he was famous. When asked for his advice, Josue would always en-\n', 'courage young people to stay in school, get good grades, and make something of \n', 'their lives. He humbled himself by sharing that once he was a C-D student and \n', 'now he had a 4.0.\n', 'Next Josue led his people on a mission to ask the government to help. Jos-\n', 'ue boarded a plane with 42 youth and parents from Vieques to fly to San Juan. \n', 'Dressed in their VYLI T-shirts, everyone stood proudly in front of La Fortaleza, \n', 'the Governor’s mansion, with their friend Tito Auger. Inside Josue gave an impas-\n', 'sioned speech demanding action from government officials. From that moment \n', 'on, everyone knew this young man was destined for greatness.\n', 'Next Josue traveled with the Mayor’s Economic Development team to Tor-\n', 'tola to study how the small business model in the British Virgin Islands supported \n', 'local companies instead of investing in the economic trap of the supermalls in \n', 'San Juan. Since Josue was now fluent in English, he was asked to make the pre-\n', 'sentation on behalf of the Mayor to the BVI Prime Minister. The Prime Minister \n', 'was so impressed he asked the Institute to bring the VYLI model to his country \n', 'to inspire BVI’s youth. Josue’s friends from the Cultural Arts & Entrepreneurship \n', 'Initiative joined him at the Caribbean Artisan Festival. As the youngest artisan/\n', 'entrepreneurs to showcase their wares, they were fascinated by the eco-foresters \n', 'from Trinidad and Tobago who grew trees and harvested the seeds to make exqui-\n', 'site jewelry. From the $4,000 they earned during the winter, they paid for their trip.\n', 'Josue continued his mission as an ambassador for Vieques youth, joining \n', 'Mayor of Vieques to meet with Puerto Rico’s First Lady, then speaking at events \n', 'in New York City and Washington, DC Later, Boston’s first Puerto Rican City \n', 'Councilman, Felix Arroyo, hosted an event celebrating the anniversary of Vi-\n', 'eques’s freedom from the U.S. Navy. Josue had become an impressive orator. \n', 'When he received the Institute’s first Walter Cronkite Award, he said, “Walter \n', 'Cronkite is an icon of the highest standard of democracy and equality. Being \n', 'the Walter Cronkite award winner was a door opening experience for me. I feel \n', 'a responsibility to carry on the legacy of a man who represents responsible and \n', ' 450\n', 'human journalism.”\n', 'Soon Josue was featured in prominent publications like Caribbean Business \n', 'and the Vineyard Gazette. People started asking Josue to be the mayor of their island. \n', 'He reminded them that he first needed to finish his education and realize his \n', 'dream of becoming a lawyer. For now, he was proud to be a 4.0 college student on \n', 'a full scholarship. As a law student, he was the only one from a family on welfare. \n', 'At his graduation he received a prestigious honor for his contribution to the people \n', 'of Vieques.\n', 'Then in 2010 Josue traveled to Martha’s Vineyard to serve on the faculty \n', 'of the Institute’s 6th Summit. There he met youth leaders from other Caribbean \n', 'islands of Bahamas, Jamaica, Barbados and from the newly formed Virgin Gorda \n', 'Youth Leadership Initiative. For his presentation on Vieques he shared his dreams \n', 'for his island community. Josue loved visiting the Vineyard, which is the same \n', 'shape and size as Vieques. He especially enjoyed learning about innovative proj-\n', 'ects he saw on the Sustainability Tours. When he visited the school’s gardens and \n', 'heard Noli Taylor’s presentation on the Island Grown Schools Initiative, a light \n', 'went on. “If they can feed their people - with just a five-month growing season, \n', 'just imagine what we could do in Puerto Rico!” he exclaimed.\n', 'Upon his return, Josue embarked on his action plan. He researched and \n', 'wrote a grant to get federal funds for school gardens. He even worked with the op-\n', 'posing political party to get both sides to work for the good of their people. Josue \n', 'is proud of the 100 school gardens they built, especially the one for handicapped \n', 'students who now have a path towards self-sufficiency, selling their produce at \n', 'the Farmer’s Market. Unfortunately, Josue also learned about the underbelly of \n', 'politics. When the press conference was held and awards were presented, Josue \n', 'wasn’t invited to the stage. While he was the one who did all the hard work, the \n', 'credit went to those from the other party. Nonetheless, Josue was proud of his ac-\n', 'complishments. The second year the grant doubled, as did the number of school \n', 'gardens. In his heart, he knew his people had the tools to feed themselves and \n', 'become self-sufficient; that was reward enough.\n', 'Josue’s next journey led him to Hawaii - 7,000 miles from his home. On the \n', 'Big Island, he swam with the dolphins, witnessed the active volcano, and reveled in \n', 'the snowcapped mountains of Mauna Lea. On the Institute’s Sustainability Tours \n', 'he learned about renewable energy projects like Hawaii Pacific Academy’s Energy \n', 'Lab. At the Waimea Elementary School garden, Josue shared his experiences in \n', 'Puerto Rico and learned new tips for organic gardening. His favorite memory is \n', 'of spending an afternoon with Nancy Redfeather in her luscious gardens. Nan-\n', '451\n', 'cy was Noli Taylor’s mentor when she first studied school gardens. Nancy was \n', 'touched that her mentee had inspired Josue to follow in her footsteps. In return, \n', 'Josue was happy to share his connections so Nancy could receive grants to support \n', 'Hawaii’s State School Garden Initiative.\n', 'After Josue’s classmates passed the Bar, they took high paying jobs and \n', 'climbed career ladders that guaranteed them a comfortable life. With his newly \n', 'minted law degree, Josue decided to first help his people get titles to their land. \n', 'People had lost their land when the Navy confiscated and razed their homes to \n', 'build new ones for its officers. Josue was Vieques’s first lawyer who could now \n', 'represent them. It was a long, arduous process. Gathering all the legal documents \n', 'to prove their ownership, then representing his people at the government’s offices \n', 'in San Juan was challenging. Josue spent many days there pleading their cases. For \n', 'him it was just the right thing to do.\n', 'Josue then traveled to Texas to join his friend Carmianne, who invited him \n', 'to join a law firm. For a while, he tried it out, but didn’t like what he saw there. \n', 'He was furious that Spanish speaking people were being robbed by some of the \n', 'lawyers, who promised to get them U.S. citizenship. So, he explored other options \n', 'before deciding to create his own firm. He put out a shingle and used social media \n', 'to post videos showing how he was an honest person with integrity. People started \n', 'coming. Word got out. People who had lived, worked, and paid taxes in the U.S. \n', 'for 10, 20, or more years were being deported. Josue was outraged. While he had \n', 'never liked going to court during his law school days, he now felt a passion to help \n', 'these people.\n', 'Then the Border Wall fiasco began. People from Central America affected \n', 'by U.S. wars and climate change were desperate. Josue saw it as his moral duty to \n', 'help families who were losing all their rights and being treated like animals, just \n', 'for trying to give their children a better future. So today, Josue’s days are long. \n', 'He doesn’t get to travel much or see his beloved island of Vieques. But he has \n', 'peace of mind knowing that he’s doing the right thing by helping people who \n', 'desperately need his help.\n', 'Now 29 years old, Josue is proud to see his friends, VYLI alumni who are \n', 'now successful doctors, lawyers, and business executives.

In order to be \n', 'taken seriously, Feliza decided that first her group needed a name and a mission \n', ' 454\n', 'statement; then they could ask for letters of support from community leaders. And \n', 'that is how the Virgin Gorda Youth Leadership Initiative (VGYLI) was born.\n', 'Feliza was happy that at the VGYLI meetings, the Institute’s team actually \n', 'listened to young people, and asked them what was important to them. Too often \n', 'in patriarchal societies, children are expected to be “seen and not heard.” But \n', 'VGYLI youth had some good ideas for how their community could be better, and \n', 'now they had a chance to put their ideas into action by organizing community \n', 'service projects.\n', 'Feliza began to imagine herself as a TV journalist, and decided she wanted \n', 'to create a VGYLI video. She thought it would be a good way to get the message \n', 'across. So she found a filmmaker, picked out background music, decided on a \n', 'location, created a script, rehearsed her voiceover message, and then cajoled her \n', 'friends into sharing their dreams on camera. And she invited local business leaders, \n', 'like the Bitter End Yacht Club owner, Dana Hokin, to talk about the importance \n', 'of training and hiring young people to work in the tourist industry on camera too.\n', 'When the film was finished, it was a hit! Everyone loved it.\n', 'At one of their meetings, VGYLI youth watched an eye-opening movie by \n', 'former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, An Inconvenient Truth. Everyone was shocked to \n', 'discover just how vulnerable their island—and our whole planet—really are to cli-\n', 'mate change. They began talking among themselves, seeing things differently, and \n', 'putting two and two together. They began thinking about why it was, for example, \n', 'that it was always 10 degrees hotter on Virgin Gorda than on the neighboring \n', 'islands. They could see that their daily lives were already being affected by climate \n', 'change. For example, with very little rainfall, Virgin Gorda had had to create the \n', 'first desalination plant in the BVI, just so everyone could have enough drinking \n', 'water. And because it has very few trees to serve as a coastal barrier, their island \n', 'was very vulnerable to hurricanes.\n', 'Feliza was concerned. Now that she’d seen the “inconvenient” truth, she \n', 'wanted everyone else to see it too. She knew that nothing would change until \n', 'people got together to make a change. She created a survey and shared it with her \n', 'community—asking people if they’d heard of climate change and if they knew \n', 'what was happening to their environment. She was even more worried when she \n', 'found that of the 80 people she surveyed, only a few had even heard of climate \n', 'change. So she wrote a report and featured it on VGYLI’s website. “While the \n', 'truth is inconvenient, we must each do our part,” she said. “Before you throw that \n', 'soda can in the road, think twice. We can be a shining example.”\n', 'Once they’d seen the movie, VGYLI youth were curious to learn more about \n', '455\n', 'their island. Thanks to a generous charter boat owner, they had the opportunity \n', 'of a lifetime when he invited them to go on an Environmental Stewards Sustain-\n', 'ability Tour. Like most Caribbean youth, they didn’t even know how to swim! And \n', 'they’d never been snorkeling. The experience was incredibly exciting for them. \n', '“When I jumped off the boat, I had to overcome my fears of heights - and be ad-\n', 'venturous,” one of them said. Another said, “I was so scared, but then I realized, I \n', 'can do it! And then I had fun.” These future youth leaders were thrilled to see all \n', 'the magical creatures who lived under the sea—right in their very own backyard! \n', 'So this is why all the tourists come to visit! they realized.\n', 'During the trip, the captain shared with the young people the harsh real-\n', 'ity of how these precious coral reefs were dying from uneducated boaters who \n', 'had anchorage habits. To make things worse, in 2005, rising sea temperatures \n', 'had bleached the coral reefs. This experience left a lasting impression on Feli-\n', 'za. “Knowledge is power,” she thought. And then, “Knowing, seeing, believing \n', '– knowing is seeing, and seeing is believing!”\n', 'Eager to learn more, in 2007 the VGYLI youth created the first Sustain-\n', 'ability Summit to be held on Virgin Gorda. Hosted by the Bitter End Yacht Club, \n', 'Virgin Gorda youth learned from the Vieques youth leaders who shared their \n', 'sustainability initiatives, as well as local business leaders, who challenged them to \n', 'study hard and pursue their dreams.\n', 'Feliza’s next adventure was to travel to St. Lucia to be a youth delegate \n', 'at the Caribbean Media Exchange (CMEx) Conference on Sustainable Tourism. \n', 'There she learned from government leaders about innovative sustainability prac-\n', 'tices that were being introduced on neighboring islands. And, emboldened by the \n', 'enthusiasm that her video had met with so far, she presented it at the next CMEx \n', 'Conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n', 'Upon graduation from high school, Feliza decided to go to college in the \n', 'United States at Texas Christian University to study journalism. Whenever she \n', 'went home for a visit, everyone looked to her for leadership, and she always en-\n', 'couraged them to do better with their lives. And while many of the BVI’s best \n', 'and brightest leave for college and then stay away, where there are more career \n', 'opportunities, Feliza was determined to return to Virgin Gorda after graduating \n', 'from college.\n', 'Putting her communications skills to work, she began as an information offi-\n', 'cer at the BVI’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Labour. Sargassum—a float-\n', 'ing seaweed that suffocates small ocean creatures was invading the BVI’s beautiful \n', 'beaches—and it had a putrid smell! The Handsome Bay beach near Feliza’s fami-\n', ' 456\n', 'ly home was covered with it! She wrote a report on the sargassum invasion for the \n', 'BVI Conservation and Fisheries Department, and harkening back to her earlier \n', 'years, she also took a lead role in preparing a report assessing BVI’s ability to cope \n', 'with a mass casualty event. It turned out to be a warning of things to come.\n', 'Working alongside BVI’s Minister of Natural Resources and Labour, Dr. \n', 'Pickering, next Feliza used her organizing and communication skills to shepherd \n', 'what would become the Climate Change Trust Fund, the first financing frame-\n', 'work in the Caribbean for climate change issues. This positioned the BVI as a \n', 'leader among small island states globally in establishing the policy and financing \n', 'framework needed to address the causes and impacts of climate change. But un-\n', 'fortunately, when the government changed hands, the project was shelved - just at \n', 'the worst possible moment.\n', 'When Hurricane Irma hit in 2018, it devastated many Caribbean islands. \n', 'Virgin Gorda was in the eye of the storm. With its few trees, the little island was \n', 'demolished, and life changed forever. The precious coral reefs were decimated. \n', 'Sargassum invaded the island, and then mosquito-borne illnesses. Feliza, like \n', 'many others, contracted the life- threatening dengue fever, with its long-lasting \n', 'symptoms. The impact of climate change was so sudden and dramatic, it turned \n', 'life upside down for everyone. Then, just as Virgin Gorda was starting to slowly \n', 'rebuild, the COVID pandemic hit, crippling the island’s economic base. Feliza, \n', 'like many others, lost her job.\n', 'In times of great challenges, Feliza has learned to be resilient and adapt \n', 'to the new reality of life on her island. Now the proud mother of four-year-old \n', 'Ifunaya, Feliza is using her organizing and communication skills once again - this \n', 'time to rally Virgin Gorda’s women to create healthier, better lives for their fami-\n', 'lies. She has launched her new company, UPLIFT, as a self-improvement training \n', 'development to help women balance their personal and professional lives, as well \n', 'as the lives of their communities. “What does it mean to be a Black Caribbean \n', 'millennial in today’s world?” is the question she is asking members of her com-\n', 'munity now. “How can we be resilient and take care of ourselves and prepare for \n', 'our children’s future?”\n', 'Feliza has always been ahead of her time. One wonders what might have \n', 'happened if Virgin Gorda’s leaders had listened to Feliza and the other young \n', 'people. Maybe they would have been better prepared to deal with climate change. \n', 'It’s never too late!\n', 'When Feliza accepted the Tortola Rotaract Club Award as the Young Pro-\n', 'fessional Public Relations Officer of the Year, she challenged the organization to \n', '457\n', 'also bring Rotaract to Virgin Gorda, which they did; and she now proudly serves \n', 'as a charter member. When asked what advice she has for youth, she says, “Don’t \n', 'allow yourself to be overwhelmed by circumstances. When I first left high school, \n', 'I never imagined that someone like me would get to go away and study something \n', 'so fun, interesting, and worthwhile.” She adds, “I want the future youth of our ter-\n', 'ritory to always put their best foot forward in whatever jobs they may have. Build \n', 'a reputation of responsibility and reliability. Make it so that if there is anything \n', 'people can say about you it is that you always do the very best you can.”\n', 'You must never be fearful about \n', 'what you are doing when it is right.\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Rosa Parks\n', 'Learn more about Virgin Gorda Youth Leadership Initiative: www.vgyli.org \n', 'Feliza’s project: www.preetbird.com\n'], 'tags': [[453, 'British Virgin Islands (BVI)'], [455, 'climate change islands'], [458, 'climate education sustainability'], [454, 'community service'], [456, 'coral reefs'], [457, 'coral reefs'], [455, 'documentaries An Inconvenient Truth (Gore)'], [453, 'Fenty, Feliza'], [457, 'funding for Caribbean climate change issues'], [455, 'Gore An Inconvenient Truth'], [458, 'Hawaii sustainability education'], [457, 'Hurricane Irma'], [455, 'An Inconvenient Truth (Gore)'], [456, 'invasive plants'], [458, 'islands sustainability resources'], [453, 'islands Virgin Gorda Youth Leadership Initiative (VGYLI)'], [458, 'Parks, Rosa'], [457, 'sargassum'], [456, 'seaweed'], [457, 'self-improvement'], [456, 'Stone Soup Leadership Institute Environmental Stewards Sustainability Tour'], [456, 'Stone Soup Leadership Institute Sustainability Summits'], [458, 'sustainable living'], [458, 'Tanaka, Trevor'], [457, 'UPLIFT'], [455, 'Virgin Gorda Youth Leadership Initiative (VGYLI)'], [453, 'women and girls Stone Soup Leadership Institute participants']]}, '105': {'person': 'Trevor Tanaka', 'title': 'What Does Sustainability Mean To You?', 'start_page_number': '458', 'story': None}}
