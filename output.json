An immigrant \n", "from Columbia, she had grown up in poverty with six siblings, and a single mother. \n", "It was a tough life.  She instilled in Jamie a sense of caring about the world. Jamie \n", "credits her own resilience to the lessons her mother taught her. \u201cIt\u2019s what made \n", "me the activist I am today.\u201d \n", "Next on a trip to Columbia to visit her cousins, Jamie had another formative \n", "experience. Her family lives near a fracking site. There, she saw rivers with dead \n", "fish in them, and polluted streams. In the city, she felt the burn of fossil fuels in \n", "the air. She knew this sort of thing was happening in the United States. But she \n", "didn\u2019t know it was also happening in Columbia too. She started to see that the \n", "environment was suffering everywhere. \u201cAnd our leaders weren\u2019t doing anything \n", "about it,\u201d she says. \n", "When the night of the 2016 election came, everything changed for Jamie. \u201cIt \n", "shattered my ideal, that the good guys would always win. I decided I wasn\u2019t going \n", "to rely on party leaders to make a difference. I was going to be the one that fought \n", "for the good guys.\u201d  That was the turning point that moved Jamie from thought \n", "to action. \n", "\u201cI started small,\u201d explains Jamie.  \u201cFirst, I got involved with Plant-for-the-\n", "Planet\u2014which was great introduction to the world of climate change advocacy. \n", "After that, I started community organizing.  I talked to legislators and politicians, \n", "and I helped put on lobbying events for environmental legislation, from Seattle \n", "to Olympia.\u201d  Jamie\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t always easy. Her rise to prominence wasn\u2019t \n", "always steady. Many times she met forceful resistance. \n", "\u201cIn January 2017, I had my first meeting with a Republican legislator. He \n", "was quite hostile,\u201d Jamie says. \u201cThe PTA was having a rally at the same time, so \n", "it was very tense. When it came time for me to talk, the legislator cut me off and \n", "said, \u2018You see these people? They want money too.\u2019 \n", "\u201cHe was not there to actually listen,\u201d clarifies Jamie. \u201cIf he was, he would\u2019ve \n", "known that I wasn\u2019t looking for money. Still, he carried on. He pulled out a bro-\n", "chure on homelessness and said, \u2018The money you want for climate justice could \n", "be helping these kids.\u2019\n", "But this is all intersectional,  Jamie thought. How come he doesn\u2019t understand? The \n", "climate crisis makes homelessness worse. It\u2019s not an isolated issue.  Jamie sighs. \u201cI had many \n", "experiences like this, where I was just shrugged off.\u201d  What was even more frus-\n", "trating is that there wasn\u2019t a single media article about the fight for climate justice. \n", "People weren\u2019t paying attention. So Jamie decided, you know what? \u201cEnough is \n", "enough!\u201d\n", "35\n", "In July 2017, Jamie decided to start a National Youth Climate March to \n", "really get people to listen. She was ready to grow from being a local organizer to \n", "being the leader of an international movement.  Jamie posted her idea for the \n", "March on social media, with an ambitious one-year timeline. At first slowly, then \n", "rapidly, the number of people who signed up from around the country grew. One \n", "year later, as promised - on July 21, 2018 - Jamie led the first Youth Climate March \n", "in Washington, DC. Thousands of young people marched on the National Mall, \n", "advocating for their right to a safe and livable future. Sister marches went on in \n", "New York City, Indianapolis, Seattle, Las Vegas, and even in Melbourne, Austra-\n", "lia, and London, U.K. Jamie was especially grateful that the march was endorsed \n", "by such varying groups as the Peoples Climate Movement, The Climate Group, \n", "Alliance for Climate Education, Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby, Indigenous Environ-\n", "mental Network, Sierra Club, Sunrise, and the Women\u2019s March Youth Empower.\n", "By July 2019, Jamie\u2019s efforts expanded in a big way. Then she upped her \n", "game with the launch of Zero Hour. Its mission: to increase the voices of diverse \n", "youth in the conversation around climate and environmental justice. She orga-\n", "nized the first Youth Climate Summit, a three-day climate justice event in Miami, \n", "Florida. All in all, the Summit trained more than 350 youth and older allies in \n", "climate justice activism and organizing.  Jamie is supporting these newly trained \n", "climate advocates to use Zero Hour\u2019s Getting to the Roots of Climate Change \n", "platform.  Now newly trained allies serve as ambassadors, and educate their local \n", "communities about the climate movement. \n", "For youth who want to get further involved in a community, Jamie\u2019s message \n", "is kind, and encouraging. \u201cGrowing up is hard,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s hard \n", "to know your place in the world. So take something you are passionate about \u2013 \n", "whether that is art, performing, cooking, or robotics \u2013 and apply that same passion \n", "to a movement.\u201d  \n", "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be climate justice,\u201d she adds. \u201cJust get involved, and get \n", "informed. Use your skills and knowledge to create the change you want to see,\u201d \n", "she says adding,  \u201cNever be afraid to use your voice. You are never too young, or \n", "too weak.\u201d  \n", "According to Jamie, this is especially true for marginalized people, who are \n", "not used to having their voices heard. \u201cYoung women. Women of color. Queer \n", "people. It\u2019s hard out there. So let\u2019s use the tools we have to come together for \n", "a common cause,\u201d she explains. \u201cSocial media can bring us together like never \n", "before,\u201d she says.  \u201cZero Hour and the Youth Climate Movement wouldn\u2019t have \n", "been possible without it. You can change the world. We did!\u201d \n", " 36\n", "For adults, Jamie\u2019s advice is simple. \u201cStop pinning your responsibility on \n", "children. The climate crisis can\u2019t wait for my generation to fight it. By the time \n", "I\u2019m old enough to be in a position of power, it\u2019ll be too late. The world will be on \n", "fire. \u2018Business as usual\u2019 isn\u2019t going to cut it this time. And words won\u2019t either. We \n", "need action. We need a major systems overhaul. And we need adults and children \n", "working together towards that goal.\u201d \n", "Jamie pauses, and lets out a heavy sigh. After a silence, she continues, \u201cYou \n", "need to be able to look your children in the eye and say, \u2018I did all I could to protect \n", "your future.

But he\u2019d never studied it in school.\n', 'As an island state, Hawaii is particularly vulnerable to changes in the weath-\n', 'er. Three thousand miles away from the nearest land mass, Hawaii imports 90% \n', 'of its food. Even little children know their families would run out of food in just \n', 'three days if the ferries didn\u2019t run. Since World War II, every Hawaiian family has \n', 'made sure to stock up on nonperishable foods like Spam: their garages are always \n', 'full of supplies.\n', 'Trevor did his best on the essay. However, after he had turned it in, the \n', 'question stayed with him. He knew his friends at private schools had had courses \n', 'in sustainability. \u201cEveryone should learn about it,\u201d he thought.\n', 'As an officer of the student council, Trevor was invited to create a resolution. \n', 'Thus, began what Trevor calls his \u201csustainability journey.\u201d The Sustainability \n', 'Resolution he wrote would require every public- school student in Hawaii to take \n', 'one course on sustainability. When he introduced it, people cautioned him not \n', 'to get his hopes up. Others, much more knowledgeable and experienced than he, \n', 'had tried for years to introduce such a measure, and had failed. But Trevor was \n', 'determined. He thought it was only right that all of Hawaii\u2019s young people should \n', 'learn about how to live sustainably.\n', 'When he was 16 years old, a local farmer and champion of school gardens, \n', 'Nancy Redfeather, nominated Trevor to serve as a youth delegate to the Stone \n', 'Soup Leadership Institute\u2019s Youth Leadership Summit for Sustainable Develop-\n', 'ment. Trevor wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but he was curious to see where this jour-\n', 'ney might lead. So, he traveled 6,000 miles, to the island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard off \n', 'the East Coast of the United States, where he met young people with big dreams \n', 'from other islands. During a week-long intensive training, he had many eye- open-\n', 'ing experiences. He loved the sustainability tours, during which they visited some \n', 'of the Vineyard\u2019s 42 farms, and kayaked the island\u2019s waterways, where they saw \n', 'oyster planting projects designed to reduce nitrogen levels.\n', 'While he was there, Trevor was fascinated to hear how those with far less \n', 'resources and opportunities than he had in Hawaii had learned how to make \n', 'things happen. He was especially impressed by Josue Cruz, a college junior from \n', 'Puerto Rico, who talked about his Five-Year Plan. At his first Summit, when he \n', '459\n', 'was 14 years old, Josue had asked himself some simple questions: What is my dream \n', 'for my life, for my island, and for my community? Since then, Josue had gone from being a \n', 'mediocre high school student to being a 4.0, full scholarship college student, who \n', 'was now heading to law school.\n', 'Trevor had never thought about having a Five-Year Plan. As a basketball \n', 'star who aimed for the state championships, he knew the importance of hard \n', 'work and discipline in achieving goals. But his horizons had always been focused \n', 'on just one semester, or one year, at a time. So, when it was time for him to create \n', 'his Five-Year Plan, he had to stretch himself: but Josue\u2019s reassurance, support. \n', 'and confidence in him made all the difference. Josue asked him some challenging \n', 'questions, which helped him expand his idea of what was possible. Trevor started \n', 'to see how he could make his dreams come true - and how he could make the \n', 'Sustainability Resolution happen.\n', 'He returned to Hawaii with greater focus, and strengthened energy for the \n', 'journey ahead. As a founding member of the Institute\u2019s Sustainable Hawaii Youth \n', 'Leadership Initiative, Trevor now put into practice what he\u2019d learned at the Sum-\n', 'mit. He made concrete action plans, and asked for help from members of the \n', 'community. He knew that he\u2019d have to learn how the government worked in order \n', 'to make the Sustainability Resolution a reality, so he was grateful when his state \n', 'representative, Denny Kaufman, agreed to meet with him. Rep. Kaufman asked \n', 'his aide, Nicole Lowen, to help Trevor write the Sustainability Resolution, and \n', 'agreed to sponsor it in the House.\n', 'Next Trevor needed to find a champion in the State Senate. Through the \n', 'Institute, he met Ian Kitajima, a seasoned business leader who took Trevor under \n', 'his wing. Trevor flew to the state capitol in Honolulu and walked the halls of \n', 'power with Ian. He was thrilled when Senator Jill Tokuda said she would support \n', 'his resolution.\n', 'Next he needed to show that other Hawaiians felt that the resolution was \n', 'important. He reached out to friends and community leaders and asked them \n', 'to write testimonials. Step by step, he built the momentum they needed. Then \n', 'he traveled back to Honolulu to present his resolution in the Senate chambers. \n', 'They were impressed with Trevor\u2019s passion and vision. After just six months, the \n', 'resolution passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate.\n', 'Everyone was amazed at Trevor\u2019s accomplishment. The press made him \n', 'a local hero. His Sustainability Resolution became his capstone project for his \n', 'senior year. And, as icing on the cake, Trevor graduated as valedictorian of his \n', 'high school class, and his team won the state championship that year.\n', ' 460\n', 'Then came the hard part - making the resolution a reality. For the next few \n', 'years, Trevor pursued his college education. He worked with the Institute\u2019s team \n', 'to organize forums with Hawaiian youth, educators, and leaders of business and \n', 'government. Using \u201cDesign Thinking\u201d language, he explored how to implement \n', 'the Sustainability Resolution. The biggest challenge was that it would cost the \n', 'schools money to adopt a new course, and Hawaii\u2019s Department of Education \n', 'just didn\u2019t have the resources. They were woefully underfunded. Teachers were \n', 'underpaid. There was just no money to add new courses, nor were there funds \n', 'available to train teachers, or develop state standards.\n', 'Then in 2014, Hawaii\u2019s Governor Ike took a bold stand: he declared that \n', 'Hawaii would have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. By now Nicole Lowen \n', 'was Trevor\u2019s new state representative, and she chaired the powerful Grants in Aid \n', 'budget. She worked with Trevor and the Institute to get a grant in partnership \n', 'with Design Thinking Hawaii. Trevor created a simple survey to engage local \n', 'youth and educators, as well as business and community leaders, to determine \n', 'what was most important to Hawaiians. He integrated the UN\u2019s Sustainable De-\n', 'velopment Goals with Hawaii\u2019s sustainability goals, and found that for Hawaiians, \n', 'food scarcity and the cost of electricity were the top issues. Through the surveys, \n', 'Trevor learned that companies were having trouble hiring people who had only a \n', '5th grade level of math proficiency to monitor their water meters. He researched \n', 'all the best programs in Hawaii, and worked with the tech team to design an \n', 'online resource \u2013 the Sustainable Hawaii Toolkit.\n', 'At the Institute\u2019s 2018 Summit, Trevor presented the toolkit to youth dele-\n', 'gates from all over New England. He\u2019d discovered it was especially challenging to \n', 'find information on local green jobs. Now a college junior, he was eager to find out \n', 'how he and others could get jobs in the emerging field of sustainability. He shared \n', 'his frustration with the Institute\u2019s tech team. All week, Trevor and Chris Aring, a \n', 'fellow Summit alumnus, grappled with this question. They decided to expand \n', 'from focusing on just Hawaii to include other states: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, \n', 'Puerto Rico, and California. They created an online tool, \u201cSustainability is Fun,\u201d \n', 'that featured all the best sustainability resources, including games and interactive \n', 'learning opportunities, as well listings of green jobs. They beta tested their pro-\n', 'totype with the Summit delegates, and got ideas for how to make it even better. \n', 'At the Summit graduation, Trevor was recognized with letters from a number \n', 'of state and local leaders of government, including Hawaii\u2019s governor. One was \n', 'from Rep. Nicole Lowen, who wrote:\n', 'Trevor Tanaka, a Konawaena High School graduate, is a beacon of excellence, in-\n', '461\n', 'spiring those around him with his commitment to creating a healthier, more sustain-\n', 'able planet. Even though some challenges may seem insurmountable, the Hawaiian \n', 'proverb \u2018A\u2018ohe hana nui ke alu \u2018ia (No task is too big when done together by all), \n', 'reminds us that we can accomplish much with dialogue and collaboration.\n', 'Then Trevor learned about the Blue Economy Corridor initiative in New \n', 'England. At the Institute\u2019s 2019 Summit, he and Chris Aring created a Design-\n', 'A-Thon, working with representatives of the Corridor, and Trevor designed a \n', 'survey to drill down into the issues they were facing. While there were pockets of \n', 'innovation happening, there wasn\u2019t a plan for how to build bridges between youth, \n', 'schools, and companies so that the economy in underserved communities could \n', 'thrive. So, Trevor and the team envisioned a Sustainable Workforce Development \n', 'Network\u2014an online ecosystem that connects youth, educators, and companies to \n', 'build sustainable economies.\n', 'As Trevor continues his journey by pursuing an MBA in business, he has \n', 'been working with the Institute\u2019s tech team to build a beta site to test at the Insti-\n', 'tute\u2019s 2020 Summit. \u201cStep by step we can build our dreams for our islands, and \n', 'for our world,\u201d he says.\n', 'Change will not come if we wait \n', 'for some other person or some other time.\n', 'We are the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for. \n', 'We are the change that we seek.\n', 'President Barack Obama\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'To learn more about opportunities to learn & build a sustainable world visit: \n', 'Sustainable Hawaii Toolkit: www. sustainhawaiitoolkit.com \n', 'SustainabilityisFun.com \n', 'SustainWDN.com'"], "tags": ["Aring, Chris", "blue economy", "Design-A-Thon", "Design Thinking", "Hawaii sustainability education", "islands sustainability resources", "jobs in sustainability field", "Obama, Barack", "Redfeather, Nancy", "Stone Soup Leadership Institute Sustainable Hawaii Youth Leadership Initiative", "Stone Soup Leadership Institute Youth Leadership Summit for Sustainable Development", "Sustainability is Fun", "Sustainability Resolution", "Sustainable Hawaii Toolkit", "Tanaka, Trevor", "technology for activism sustainability resources"]}}
