He was especially impressed by Josue Cruz, a college junior from \n", "Puerto Rico, who talked about his Five-Year Plan. At his first Summit, when he \n", "459\n", "was 14 years old, Josue had asked himself some simple questions: What is my dream \n", "for my life, for my island, and for my community? Since then, Josue had gone from being a \n", "mediocre high school student to being a 4.0, full scholarship college student, who \n", "was now heading to law school.\n", "Trevor had never thought about having a Five-Year Plan. As a basketball \n", "star who aimed for the state championships, he knew the importance of hard \n", "work and discipline in achieving goals. But his horizons had always been focused \n", "on just one semester, or one year, at a time. So, when it was time for him to create \n", "his Five-Year Plan, he had to stretch himself: but Josue\u2019s reassurance, support. \n", "and confidence in him made all the difference. Josue asked him some challenging \n", "questions, which helped him expand his idea of what was possible. Trevor started \n", "to see how he could make his dreams come true - and how he could make the \n", "Sustainability Resolution happen.\n", "He returned to Hawaii with greater focus, and strengthened energy for the \n", "journey ahead.

He knew that he\u2019d have to learn how the government worked in order \n", "to make the Sustainability Resolution a reality, so he was grateful when his state \n", "representative, Denny Kaufman, agreed to meet with him. Rep. Kaufman asked \n", "his aide, Nicole Lowen, to help Trevor write the Sustainability Resolution, and \n", "agreed to sponsor it in the House.\n", "Next Trevor needed to find a champion in the State Senate. Through the \n", "Institute, he met Ian Kitajima, a seasoned business leader who took Trevor under \n", "his wing.

For the next few \n", "years, Trevor pursued his college education.

Using \u201cDesign Thinking\u201d language, he explored how to implement \n", "the Sustainability Resolution. The biggest challenge was that it would cost the \n", "schools money to adopt a new course, and Hawaii\u2019s Department of Education \n", "just didn\u2019t have the resources. They were woefully underfunded. Teachers were \n", "underpaid. There was just no money to add new courses, nor were there funds \n", "available to train teachers, or develop state standards.\n", "Then in 2014, Hawaii\u2019s Governor Ike took a bold stand: he declared that \n", "Hawaii would have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045.

All week, Trevor and Chris Aring, a \n", "fellow Summit alumnus, grappled with this question.
