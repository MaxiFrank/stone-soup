0,Jamie Margolin,All Hands On Deck: This Is Zero Hour,34,38,"['All Hands on Deck: This is Zero Hour\n', 'Jamie Margolin | Seattle, Washington\n', 'In West Seattle, there is an urban sanctuary called Lincoln Park. With its \n', 'many unique natural features, it’s as impressive as any in the Pacific Northwest. \n', 'From its old growth trees. Winding footpaths. Expansive views of Puget Sound. \n', 'Sandy beaches dotted with glacial rocks and footprints.\n', 'It’s here, in this serene setting, that Jamie Margolin likes to connect with \n', 'nature, which she does often. But one day, when she was walking on the beach, she \n', 'saw a sign literally – that set her on her journey as a climate justice activist. “There \n', 'was a sign that read, ‘Please don’t feed the seal pups.’ I don’t know why, but the \n', 'message struck me as odd. In all the times I’d visited, I’d never seen any seal pups.” \n', 'Jamie knew something wasn’t adding up. But like the rest of her concerns \n', 'about the climate situation, she pushed it deep down. Hoping to forget, to move \n', 'on. So she kept walking. Further along the beach, another sign read, “These are \n', 'the whales and porpoises that you’ll commonly see around this bay.” \n', '“It was just like before. I’d never seen any whales or porpoises here. None of \n', 'my friends had either. That’s when I realized there’s a disconnect in our way of \n', 'thinking,” admits Jamie. “We see what we want to see, not what we need to see.”  \n', 'She continues, “Of course, these animals were here once, when the indigenous \n', 'peoples who cared for the land lived in this region. This really got me thinking \n', 'deeply about my own culture and the environment for the first time.”\n', 'Jamie might have become a devoted climate justice activist that day, at age \n', '14. But the groundwork for her activism had started long before that. Jamie’s \n', 'father is a bookish man, a Reform Jewish thinker who always listens to the news. \n', '“Politics is a constant in my life,” she says. “My dad is to thank for that. Believe it \n', 'or not, I didn’t grow up watching Hannah Montana. Nothing like that. For fun, we \n', 'watched The Colbert Report. Or The Daily Show. Or just the plain old news,” Jamie \n', 'says smiling.  “This really helped shape my perspective.” \n', ' 34\n', 'Jamie’s mother also had a huge impact on her world view. An immigrant \n', 'from Columbia, she had grown up in poverty with six siblings, and a single mother. \n', 'It was a tough life.  She instilled in Jamie a sense of caring about the world. Jamie \n', 'credits her own resilience to the lessons her mother taught her. “It’s what made \n', 'me the activist I am today.” \n', 'Next on a trip to Columbia to visit her cousins, Jamie had another formative \n', 'experience. Her family lives near a fracking site. There, she saw rivers with dead \n', 'fish in them, and polluted streams. In the city, she felt the burn of fossil fuels in \n', 'the air. She knew this sort of thing was happening in the United States. But she \n', 'didn’t know it was also happening in Columbia too. She started to see that the \n', 'environment was suffering everywhere. “And our leaders weren’t doing anything \n', 'about it,” she says. \n', 'When the night of the 2016 election came, everything changed for Jamie. “It \n', 'shattered my ideal, that the good guys would always win. I decided I wasn’t going \n', 'to rely on party leaders to make a difference. I was going to be the one that fought \n', 'for the good guys.”  That was the turning point that moved Jamie from thought \n', 'to action. \n', '“I started small,” explains Jamie.  “First, I got involved with Plant-for-the-\n', 'Planet—which was great introduction to the world of climate change advocacy. \n', 'After that, I started community organizing.  I talked to legislators and politicians, \n', 'and I helped put on lobbying events for environmental legislation, from Seattle \n', 'to Olympia.”  Jamie’s journey wasn’t always easy. Her rise to prominence wasn’t \n', 'always steady. Many times she met forceful resistance. \n', '“In January 2017, I had my first meeting with a Republican legislator. He \n', 'was quite hostile,” Jamie says. “The PTA was having a rally at the same time, so \n', 'it was very tense. When it came time for me to talk, the legislator cut me off and \n', 'said, ‘You see these people? They want money too.’ \n', '“He was not there to actually listen,” clarifies Jamie. “If he was, he would’ve \n', 'known that I wasn’t looking for money. Still, he carried on. He pulled out a bro-\n', 'chure on homelessness and said, ‘The money you want for climate justice could \n', 'be helping these kids.’\n', 'But this is all intersectional,  Jamie thought. How come he doesn’t understand? The \n', 'climate crisis makes homelessness worse. It’s not an isolated issue.  Jamie sighs. “I had many \n', 'experiences like this, where I was just shrugged off.”  What was even more frus-\n', 'trating is that there wasn’t a single media article about the fight for climate justice. \n', 'People weren’t paying attention. So Jamie decided, you know what? “Enough is \n', 'enough!”\n', '35\n', 'In July 2017, Jamie decided to start a National Youth Climate March to \n', 'really get people to listen. She was ready to grow from being a local organizer to \n', 'being the leader of an international movement.  Jamie posted her idea for the \n', 'March on social media, with an ambitious one-year timeline. At first slowly, then \n', 'rapidly, the number of people who signed up from around the country grew. One \n', 'year later, as promised - on July 21, 2018 - Jamie led the first Youth Climate March \n', 'in Washington, DC. Thousands of young people marched on the National Mall, \n', 'advocating for their right to a safe and livable future. Sister marches went on in \n', 'New York City, Indianapolis, Seattle, Las Vegas, and even in Melbourne, Austra-\n', 'lia, and London, U.K. Jamie was especially grateful that the march was endorsed \n', 'by such varying groups as the Peoples Climate Movement, The Climate Group, \n', 'Alliance for Climate Education, Citizens’ Climate Lobby, Indigenous Environ-\n', 'mental Network, Sierra Club, Sunrise, and the Women’s March Youth Empower.\n', 'By July 2019, Jamie’s efforts expanded in a big way. Then she upped her \n', 'game with the launch of Zero Hour. Its mission: to increase the voices of diverse \n', 'youth in the conversation around climate and environmental justice. She orga-\n', 'nized the first Youth Climate Summit, a three-day climate justice event in Miami, \n', 'Florida. All in all, the Summit trained more than 350 youth and older allies in \n', 'climate justice activism and organizing.  Jamie is supporting these newly trained \n', 'climate advocates to use Zero Hour’s Getting to the Roots of Climate Change \n', 'platform.  Now newly trained allies serve as ambassadors, and educate their local \n', 'communities about the climate movement. \n', 'For youth who want to get further involved in a community, Jamie’s message \n', 'is kind, and encouraging. “Growing up is hard,” she says. “Sometimes, it’s hard \n', 'to know your place in the world. So take something you are passionate about – \n', 'whether that is art, performing, cooking, or robotics – and apply that same passion \n', 'to a movement.”  \n', '“It doesn’t need to be climate justice,” she adds. “Just get involved, and get \n', 'informed. Use your skills and knowledge to create the change you want to see,” \n', 'she says adding,  “Never be afraid to use your voice. You are never too young, or \n', 'too weak.”  \n', 'According to Jamie, this is especially true for marginalized people, who are \n', 'not used to having their voices heard. “Young women. Women of color. Queer \n', 'people. It’s hard out there. So let’s use the tools we have to come together for \n', 'a common cause,” she explains. “Social media can bring us together like never \n', 'before,” she says.  “Zero Hour and the Youth Climate Movement wouldn’t have \n', 'been possible without it. You can change the world. We did!” \n', ' 36\n', 'For adults, Jamie’s advice is simple. “Stop pinning your responsibility on \n', 'children. The climate crisis can’t wait for my generation to fight it. By the time \n', 'I’m old enough to be in a position of power, it’ll be too late. The world will be on \n', 'fire. ‘Business as usual’ isn’t going to cut it this time. And words won’t either. We \n', 'need action. We need a major systems overhaul. And we need adults and children \n', 'working together towards that goal.” \n', 'Jamie pauses, and lets out a heavy sigh. After a silence, she continues, “You \n', 'need to be able to look your children in the eye and say, ‘I did all I could to protect \n', 'your future. I fought the battle against climate change. I turned over every stone I \n', 'possibly could.’ Adults need to ask themselves—and be honest—‘Have I done all \n', 'that I can for climate justice?’”\n', 'It’s a big ask. But according to Jamie, it’s a necessary one. “We can’t just \n', 'ignore it—and hope someone else will deal with it. Ensuring climate justice for \n', 'future generations is an enormous task. As a country, we must all come together. \n', 'As brothers and sisters together, we must have an answer to that big question. \n', '‘Have we done all that we can for climate justice?’” Jamie Margolin is counting on \n', 'everyone to stand up and be counted.\n', 'To cherish what remains of the Earth and  \n', 'to foster its renewal is our only legitimate \n', 'hope of survival.\n', 'Wendell Berry\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Join Zero Hour to demand climate action now! thisiszerohour.org \n', 'Buy Jamie’s book, Youth To Power at www.youthtopowerbook.com \n', 'Follow Jamie on Twitter @jamie_margolin\n', '37\n']","['air pollution fracking', 'Berry, Wendell', 'climate change intersectionality with human rights issues', 'climate change activism inclusivity in youth climate movement', 'climate change activism training youth', 'climate change activism training youth', 'climate justice diversity and inclusivity', 'diversity', 'fracking', 'intersectionality climate change and human rights', 'x communities', 'Margolin, Jamie', 'National Youth Climate March', 'Plant-for-the-Planet', 'social media as tool for activism', 'water pollution extractive industries', 'women and girls climate change activists', 'Youth Climate March', 'Youth Climate Summit', 'Youth To Power (Margolin)', 'Zero Hour']"
1,Alec Loorz,An Inconvenient Youth,38,41,"['An Inconvenient Youth\n', 'Alec Loorz | Olympia, Washington\n', 'Young Alec Loorz was awestruck when he found himself standing on a stage \n', 'with former Vice President Al Gore. “He told me he’d read my letter,” he says. \n', '“That day I felt like I was in a dreamworld, on stage with my hero.”\n', 'For Alec, watching An Inconvenient Truth when he was just 12 years old was a \n', 'turning point in his life. “It gave me that spark to really take action. Before that, I \n', 'was aware of climate change in a roundabout way. But that film made it real for \n', 'me. And I wanted to do something about it.”\n', 'When Al Gore’s documentary film, An Inconvenient Truth was released in 2006, \n', 'it created a renewed interest in the climate conversation globally – and that was \n', 'his goal. The conversation around the impending climate crisis had gone stale, \n', 'and needed to be reinvigorated. As a popular political figure, Gore knew he could \n', 'influence change. Alec was among the countless environmental advocates inspired \n', 'by the film, which to this day continues to create passionate climate activists.\n', 'From the moment Alec saw the film, he started spreading the word. Most \n', 'people Alec’s age weren’t aware of the climate movement. “I got into an argu-\n', 'ment with one of my friends about it,” he says, with a laugh. “Over time, I did a \n', 'lot of research on the issues, and my own story became intertwined. I felt a sense \n', 'of calling to be a part of the transition to a sustainable society.”\n', 'Alec learned a lot on his own. But he knew he needed to be around top \n', 'experts to really be able to make the wide-ranging impact he wanted to. So he de-\n', 'cided to go straight to the source of his inspiration. “Mr. Gore’s organization, the \n', 'Climate Reality Project, had a training program. However, they had an age cutoff, \n', 'and since I was only 13, I was turned down.” But Alec didn’t let that stop him; he \n', 'worked privately, behind the scenes. “I even sent a letter to Mr. Gore, saying how \n', 'I was rejected from the training, but I still wanted to be involved.”\n', 'Now, standing on the stage with his hero, Alec’s persistence had paid off. \n', ' 38\n', 'Mr. Gore told Alec that anybody with his passion should definitely be involved \n', 'in the cause. The very next week Alec got an invitation to join the next training \n', 'in Nashville, where he would become the youngest person ever trained. “That \n', 'was an unbelievable three days,” Alec says. At the end of the program, he was \n', 'equipped with a CD full of slides and directed to go out with it, into the world.\n', 'Alec had begun his environmental journey while still in middle school, by \n', 'founding Kids vs. Global Warming. He constructed signs throughout his coastal \n', 'city of Ventura, California, warning about the impacts of sea level rise. News of \n', 'his work began to leak out to the national press, and an intense public speaking \n', 'schedule emerged. All through high school Alec was a popular speaker: he gave \n', 'more than 1,000 presentations to over half a million people, most of them youth. \n', 'And he received prestigious awards, including the Coretta Scott King A.N.G.E.L. \n', 'Award, and the Brower Youth Award from the Earth Island Institute.\n', 'In 2010, at age 16, Alec cofounded iMatter with his mother, to support \n', 'youth-centered climate action. They held the first worldwide youth climate march \n', 'in 2011, with 45 countries participating. The same year, Alec and other iMatter \n', 'leaders acted as plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the U.S. federal government, on the \n', 'grounds that it has not lived up to its responsibility to protect the atmosphere for \n', 'future generations.\n', '“We actually made it all the way to U.S. federal court,” he says, proudly. “But \n', 'then the fossil fuel lobby got involved. They intervened in the case and sent some \n', 'really good lawyers, and they defeated it.” But, he adds, “The fact that they sent \n', 'their best lawyers to shut us down showed we were considered a serious threat \n', '–and we will continue to be. While we lost that lawsuit, this legal approach goes on \n', 'today. And will in the future.”\n', 'Alec continued to campaign. But he knew that the movement’s strategy \n', 'couldn’t be to just keep writing letters and having protests. “It felt like that famous \n', 'Einstein saying, like we were doing the same thing over and over again and ex-\n', 'pecting different results. I got frustrated. And so I decided to go out in search of \n', 'other perspectives.”\n', 'Alec visited Iceland, where he walked on a glacier that scientists say will \n', 'be gone in 100 years. He crossed the United States multiple times, visiting and \n', 'learning from organic farming coops that have a healthy relationship with the \n', 'land and their communities. He visited Indigenous people in Ecuador whose land \n', 'was threatened by extractive industry.\n', 'By 2017, Alec’s travels had led him to southeastern Utah. Here, at the Bears \n', 'Ears National Monument, he participated in a retreat as the Kalliopeia Founda-\n', '39\n', 'tion’s Spiritual Ecology Fellow.\n', 'Bears Ears is a national monument that was established in 2016 to protect \n', 'around 1.3 million acres from development. But in 2017, at the very time Alec \n', 'was on retreat there, a fateful announcement was made – the protected land area \n', 'was to be reduced by about 85 percent, to open up the lands to mining operations. \n', 'Simultaneously, nearly 900,000 acres was to be slashed from the Grand Stair-\n', 'case-Escalante Monument. Being there at the time, Alec had an insight.\n', '“If I try to identify what’s missing with the movement, it’s this core feature, \n', 'this idea of ‘us vs. them’. On one side, it’s the people trying to protect Bears Ears, \n', 'and on the other, it’s those who see the land as a resource to exploit. Yes, we have \n', 'differing viewpoints, and their actions can be damaging.” He pauses, then adds. \n', '“But I don’t think that the ‘us vs. them’ mentality will stop it. We’re all just people. \n', 'If we keep this kind of thinking up, we’ll just be repeating the same cycles of \n', 'division that got us standing on opposite sides of the issue in the first place. We’re \n', 'all together in this world, so we should come together and listen to one another. \n', 'It’s our only choice.”\n', 'Alec realized that in all his travels, whether he was in Iceland, the United \n', 'States, the Amazon or the Andes, there’s one tried and true method to bring \n', 'people together in their reverence for a land and its people – and that is through \n', 'telling stories. “My work has led me to the point where I think that telling stories \n', 'about places and people is the way forward. We can’t approach climate change \n', 'as this whole big abstract thing, where we’re saving the whole wide world. It’s too \n', 'broad. The only way to approach the depths of this, to really change how we live, \n', 'is to deep dive into specific spaces; and to explore the human relationship with \n', 'these spaces through storytelling.”\n', 'Now, through filmmaking, writing, and photography, Alec hopes to explore \n', 'new ways of telling stories that can address the depth and complexity of this \n', 'situation. Coupled with this change in his perspective, he also believes that more \n', 'people, including more young activists and advocates, need to actually get out into \n', 'the world and spend some significant time in nature, to gain a different perspec-\n', 'tive on what we really need to do to heal our planet.\n', '“Go outside—and keep going out,” he says. “This is not emphasized enough. \n', 'For anyone who wants to do this work, it’s going to be difficult. It’s emotional, and \n', 'at times even heart-wrenching. But it’s also freeing, to take a stand on behalf of \n', 'something bigger than yourself. We will lose ourselves if we don’t connect with the \n', 'places in our world that are real, and wild, and alive.”\n', 'Despite his struggles in coming to terms with what to do about such a big \n', ' 40\n', 'problem, Alec’s message to youth is one of hope. “The potential of young people \n', 'is greater than we realize,” he says. “Sometimes we tend to think, ‘We can try, but \n', 'we’re just kids, so no one will listen.’ But I’ve found the opposite to be true. There’s \n', 'something in young people standing up and doing what they feel is right that is \n', 'deeply powerful. We have this opportunity to come together in a new way. And to \n', 'create the future we want to grow up into.”\n', 'Alec’s story of coming of age in a time of radical transition can inspire \n', 'young people today. Let’s start telling the stories of people like Alec, and others \n', 'who have devoted themselves to fighting for our planet. It’s time to let those stories \n', 'help us all find ways to live lives that we can feel proud of.\n', 'I have always been fascinated with those\n', ' who try to look over the horizon and\n', ' see things that are coming at us.\n', 'Al Gore\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Visit the Climate Reality Project at climaterealityproject.org\n']","['Bears Ears National Monument', 'climate change activism policy change', 'climate change activism storytelling', 'Climate Reality Project', 'Climate Reality Project', 'documentaries An Inconvenient Truth (Gore)', 'Gore An Inconvenient Truth', 'Gore Climate Reality Project', 'Gore Climate Reality Project', 'iMatter', 'An Inconvenient Truth (Gore)', 'Kids vs. Global Warming', 'Loorz, Alec', 'mining operations', 'storytelling as tool for climate activism', 'women and girls climate change activists']"
2,Lilly Platt,Caring For The Circle Of Life,41,46,"['Caring For The Circle Of Life\n', 'Lilly Platt | The Netherlands\n', 'Twelve-year-old Lilly Platt has a special gift. “I can tell if any animal is \n', 'sad, angry, or if it wants food,” she says. She loves all animals, big or small. Her \n', 'favorites are snow leopards, blobfishes, and her pug puppy Mochi.\n', 'Lilly feels sad when she hears about whales dying. “When a whale eats plastic, \n', '41\n', 'it makes them feel full,” she explains. “So then they don’t want to eat food. And \n', 'they die.” She adds, “Whales are similar to humans, they’re intelligent and they \n', 'have a connection with nature. They have every single right to live on this planet.”\n', 'Lilly’s journey into environmental activism began with a walk she took with \n', 'her grandfather one day. When she was six years old, she moved with her family \n', 'from London to the Netherlands, to live on the edge of a beautiful green forest in \n', 'the city of Zeist. During that 20-minute walk, Lilly was shocked to see trash every-\n', 'where: on the road, in the fields, and thrown over the fence. “It was everywhere!” \n', 'she says. “At the time, I couldn’t really count in Dutch, so I practiced my Dutch \n', 'by counting all of these cans, bottles, and pieces of plastic. I counted 91 pieces! It \n', 'opened my mind. I realized there is just so much plastic in the world.”\n', 'And she decided then and there that she needed to do something about it.\n', 'A curious child, Lilly began by studying. She watched David Attenborough’s \n', 'documentaries, and listened to Jane Goodall’s speeches. She discovered that only \n', 'recently did plastics become popular, and now we are using 5 trillion plastic bags a \n', 'year. Since plastics are made out of fossil fuels, they are made to last. This means \n', 'that they are not biodegradable: the plastic just breaks down into smaller pieces \n', 'of plastic.\n', 'Lilly was disturbed to learn from her grandfather that any piece of plastic \n', 'that falls on the ground eventually makes its way into the ocean, through rivers \n', 'or other waterways. And from there it makes its way into a kind of plastic soup in \n', 'the ocean. In the Netherlands, rising sea levels threaten the nation’s very existence. \n', 'And with the Arctic ice melting, all of the plastic pieces from the earth are ending \n', 'up at the bottom of the sea.\n', 'The circle of life begins with plankton, the lowest form of life on the food \n', 'chain. The plankton eat microplastics, then smaller fish eat the plankton, then \n', 'larger fish eat the smaller fish, all the way up to the whales. When people eat fish \n', 'with plastic in their stomachs, the plastic gets inside of them too. “Once you know \n', 'this, you can never un-see that piece of plastic,” Lilly says. “When you pick up one \n', 'piece of plastic, you might actually be saving the life of an animal.”\n', 'To raise awareness, Lilly started picking up litter, and posting pictures of \n', 'the trash she had collected on her Facebook page. She organized cleanups in her \n', 'community, and recruited her friends to help. Together they picked up about 500 \n', 'pieces of plastic a week. Since she began, they’ve picked up nearly 200,000 pieces. \n', 'Each time Lilly takes a photo of the colored bottles, paper, and plastic, and posts it \n', 'before taking it to the recycling center. Lilly’s family then takes the broken electric \n', 'items to be mended at the repair cafes. The move to having a circular economy \n', ' 42\n', 'is very big there!\n', 'Lilly is also campaigning to stop litter at its source. She helped get her mu-\n', 'nicipality to join the Deposit Scheme Alliance for small bottles and cans. And she \n', 'is now raising awareness about the harmful effects of balloons. She hopes they \n', 'can be banned. “Have you ever seen the way animals suffer when they eat plastic?” \n', 'she asks, and adds, “One time we saw a picture of a baby puffin wrapped in \n', 'balloons, and it made me very cross.” So she and her mother spoke to the local car \n', 'dealer and convinced them to stop releasing balloons. And, as a youth ambassador \n', 'for the Plastic Pollution Coalition she speaks about the five Rs: recycle, renew, \n', 'reuse, refuse, and refill. “The refuse part inspired me to create a set of bamboo \n', 'straws,” she says.\n', 'After watching Greta Thunberg’s videos, Lilly was inspired to organize \n', 'school strikes to increase awareness of climate change. “At first lots of people \n', 'didn’t really know why I was doing it,” she says. “Then more people started to get \n', 'the message, and they started striking too.”\n', 'Lilly firmly believes that environmental issues must be taught in schools. “If \n', 'children learned about climate change, or about plastic pollution, and what they \n', 'can do to stop it, you could build a whole generation who actually care for the \n', 'environment instead of destroying it.”\n', 'When Indigenous people from the Amazon visited one of her school strikes, \n', 'they told her about the crisis in the rainforest. She was horrified to learn that \n', 'Brazil’s president was spreading fake news, saying that Indigenous people were \n', 'the number-one enemy. She has proudly served on the Amazon Watch panel, to \n', 'support Indigenous peoples’ rights.\n', 'A frequent speaker at schools and at TEDx talks, Lilly shares her four- point \n', 'plan: spot it; pick it up; put it in the bin; work to stop trash at the source by making \n', 'less of it yourself. “Leave five extra minutes every day to pick up trash,” she urges. \n', '“Get a bag. Get a grabber. Let’s clean up the world! Who’s with me?”\n', 'In 2018, Lily was voted by Onalytica as number 28 on their prestigious \n', 'top 100 environmentalists list, alongside fellow activists like Leonardo DiCaprio, \n', 'Mark Ruffalo, Dianna Cohen, and the Mayor of London. She also won the Green \n', 'Feather from the Netherlands’ Green Party, and she has been featured in Nation-\n', 'al Geographic Kids. She is also a global youth ambassador for Youth Mundus, a \n', 'youth-driven festival inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development \n', 'Goals, and a youth ambassador for Earth.org. In 2020 she was selected, out of \n', 'hundreds of contenders, to speak at the first-ever virtual UN World Oceans Day, \n', 'along with Secretary General Antonio Guterres and other dignitaries, and she \n', '43\n', 'served on the youth panel there too.\n', 'Lilly travels around the world, and she cleans up plastic wherever she goes. \n', 'She’s been to Norway, Canada, Scotland, England, Egypt, and the Caribbean \n', 'island of Curacao, where Prime Minister Rhuggenath invited her to speak, and \n', 'translated her speech into Papiamento so local students could understand. She \n', 'was especially happy to hear that the parliament is now planning to ban all plastic \n', 'straws in Curaçao.\n', 'Even when she’s speaking to world leaders, Lilly doesn’t get too nervous. “I \n', 'usually think about how many people are actually doing something,” she says. “I \n', 'focus on what I need to fight for.”\n', 'In November 2019, Lilly had a harsh learning experience. The European \n', 'Parliament had convened a climate debate in Strasbourg, France, to discuss the \n', 'climate crisis. There were 751 seats, and only 28 politicians showed up. Only three \n', 'of the politicians actually listened to Lilly and the other school strikers. “It showed \n', 'me just how lazy some politicians can be, and how they treat climate change,” \n', 'Lilly says, angrily. “We really have to wake them up and get them to see that our \n', 'planet is in trouble.”\n', 'When you ask Lilly about her hopes and dreams, she says, “I want all world \n', 'leaders to keep to 1.5 of global warming temperatures.” She adds, “My hope is \n', 'that people will finally realize that we should never take our planet for granted. \n', 'Our planet is not a credit card, with no spending limit. Our planet is one in a \n', 'billion, billion trillion. That’s a one followed by 33 zeros! People really need to \n', 'know that our planet is sacred, and we need to take care of it.”\n', 'When asked about her message to adults Lilly says, “You have seen so many \n', 'natural wonders on our planet. Now they are being destroyed. Don’t you want the \n', 'next generation to see the wonders you experienced? Nature is the place houses \n', 'are built, and trees are grown. It has been used for thousands, if not millions of \n', 'years, to give life to so many creatures on this planet.”\n', 'Lilly is especially committed to giving the right to vote to the younger gen-\n', 'eration. Last year, she and her grandfather started a new tradition: he is “gifting” \n', 'his vote to Lilly. When he voted in the European elections, they went together to \n', 'the polling station. “I made the cross on the paper, but it was Lilly’s choice that \n', 'I recorded,” he says. He adds, “Too much of the world is controlled by older \n', 'people, whose ideas are rooted in the past and are reluctant to make any change. \n', 'The future belongs to the young. They’re the ones who are going to have to live it. \n', 'We have to do everything we can to ensure that the voices of the young are heard, \n', 'that it counts. The gift of a vote from an older person to a younger person sends \n', ' 44\n', 'a powerful message.”\n', 'When Lilly attended the Ocean Heroes Boot Camp in Vancouver, she met \n', 'a kindred spirit in Jamie Margolin.

3,Iris Zhan,Climate Movements In A Digital World,46,49,"['Climate Movements In A Digital World\n', 'Iris Zhan | Maryland\n', 'Iris Zhan was in the third grade when she first learned about the climate \n', 'crisis and about how the earth is suffering. “When our teacher told us about global \n', 'warming and climate change, it really took a toll on me. I wondered, how can we \n', 'have such a huge problem, and no one is doing anything about it?” She turned \n', 'over the problem in her mind all night, and in the morning she went to school \n', 'ready to learn more about what she could do to solve it. But the next day, her class \n', 'was already moving on to another subject. “We were presented with the reality of \n', 'our dire situation, and just like that, that was the end of our climate education.”\n', 'But Iris wasn’t about to stop there: she wanted to find a way to make an \n', 'impact on this climate crisis outside of the classroom.\n', 'She began spending countless hours after school, educating herself on the \n', 'myriad issues related to climate justice. She devoured news articles, read scientific \n', 'papers, and perused social media for trending stories, so she could learn about \n', 'the people involved in fighting for climate justice, and the issues she needed to \n', 'understand. Over time, she became a self- taught expert on many environmental \n', 'issues–but she struggled with trying to figure out what to do with all of her knowl-\n', 'edge. “I was just a young girl trying to find a way to take on these gigantic issues,” \n', 'she says. “A lot of the time I felt really alone.”\n', 'The 2016 election was a turning point for Iris: she decided that no matter \n', 'how hard and long the journey for climate justice was, she was going to take up \n', 'the mantle for the youth of her generation. “The climate situation had become \n', 'so urgent that I realized I had to take the energy I was putting into pursuing my \n', 'environmental interests, and shift into action.”\n', 'Iris quickly realized that she couldn’t take on these massive environmental \n', 'problems alone. So she attended a local green festival that was being held near \n', 'her home in Howard County, Maryland, and she began networking with local \n', ' 46\n', 'environmental groups, clubs, associations, and grassroots organizations. This led \n', 'to some minor community organizing efforts with Less Plastic Please, Citizens’ \n', 'Climate Lobby, and the River Hill Watershed Committee.\n', 'It was a start, but Iris knew there was a bigger mission in store for her.\n', 'While organizing with these various communities, one thing stood out to \n', 'Iris—all of these groups were adult-led. There was little or no youth engagement \n', 'in Howard County on environmental issues. Through HoCo Climate Action, she \n', 'learned about the work of Jamie Margolin and Zero Hour, and she understood \n', 'her calling at once: she decided to begin organizing the youth of Howard County, \n', 'and to create a supportive community for dealing with issues of climate justice. \n', '“Learning about Jamie and what she was doing online—and with the Youth Cli-\n', 'mate March—was so inspiring,” she says. “There was nothing like that here.”\n', 'The fact that it was a young woman leading these events was inspirational for \n', 'Iris on a whole different level. “I said, you know what? If Jamie can get out there \n', 'and lead a climate march, why can’t I?”\n', 'And so she decided to take the lead. She started by creating Sunrise Move-\n', 'ment Howard County–a local chapter of the Sunrise Movement. Sunrise is a \n', 'national youth-led movement that supports the Green New Deal, and works to \n', 'make climate change a priority issue for legislation.\n', 'As an introvert, it wasn’t easy for Iris to be such a visible leader in this way, \n', 'but she knew it was something her community desperately needed. “To really \n', 'achieve change, we needed more people on board in my community. And we \n', 'needed the youth to be visible. Relying on adult-led organizations to bring young \n', 'people in was not going to be effective. These issues are going to affect the youth \n', 'the most, so I saw the importance of taking the initiative.”\n', 'Iris began leading climate marches, walkouts, strikes; and she lobbied fre-\n', 'quently in her hometown. She was so successful that she became a trainer for \n', 'Sunrise on a national level, educating other youth leaders around the country on \n', 'climate issues.\n', 'She also cofounded Fridays For Future Digital (FFFD), to expand digital \n', 'climate protests worldwide. “It started as just one sign each week, a sign that had \n', 'a message in support of climate justice. But the more people began to join the \n', 'movement, the more complex it became. Before we knew it, we were internation-\n', 'al. It was amazing!” She adds, “We wanted to take real digital actions to make \n', 'change, and we did. We’re proud of that.” To date, FFFD has partnered on digital \n', 'events with Polluters Out, Extinction Rebellion, and Re-Earth Initiative to bring \n', 'youth activists of all backgrounds together in support of climate justice for all.\n', '47\n', 'FFF Digital is now focused on increasing impact and accessibility in the \n', 'climate movement by providing local groups with the resources and skills they \n', 'need to create awesome digital campaigns. Through directly organizing with local \n', 'groups, they hope to bring new people into the movement, raise awareness of \n', 'climate justice and science issues, and put pressure on institutions to change.\n', 'Iris has been an effective youth organizer, but her success didn’t come easy. \n', 'There were lots of struggles along the way. She hopes to be able to provide some \n', 'guidance for youth who are just entering this space, so they know what they are up \n', 'against. “It’s important that other youth who want to get involved with cause-re-\n', 'lated work understand that adversity is part of the journey,” she says. “All you can \n', 'do is try to innovate, solve problems, and build communities along the way. And \n', 'when you get through to the other side—which you will—you will be glad you \n', 'took on the world.”\n', 'For youth leaders, peer pressure can be a tough issue to deal with. At the \n', 'onset of her journey, few of Iris’s peers understood what she was trying to do with \n', 'her climate justice activities. “I got a lot of criticism from the kids at my school \n', 'who didn’t get what climate justice was all about. Sometimes I even heard mum-\n', 'blings from the adults. I definitely didn’t get the support I thought I would. But \n', 'once you grow a little, you will see that those jeers are so small when compared to \n', 'the scale of the climate crisis.”\n', 'Working heavily in the digital arena, there are also some bullying issues that \n', 'Iris has had to learn how to deal with. “The biggest issue climate activists face on-\n', 'line are the trolls. Insults about your looks. Your race. Your gender. It can be pretty \n', 'toxic stuff. But you know you are having success when people waste their time \n', 'trying to come at you online,” she says, with a laugh. “The internet allows for such \n', 'amazing community building, like the community we’ve built with FFFD. It can \n', 'be hard at times dealing with that darker side of digital engagement, but there’s \n', 'no point in listening to the negativity. We have to let the good shine through.”\n', 'In the future Iris wants to work on strengthening the communities that sup-\n', 'port the climate justice movement. “I’ve met some of my best friends building \n', 'communities that do good. And I hear from people all around the world every day \n', 'about how I’ve impacted them. It makes me want to create more communities, \n', 'and I want the people and the networks to become even stronger.” She believes \n', 'that they will be, when all people are given the tools and access to contribute \n', 'equally to the community and the movement. “Everybody can play a part,” she \n', 'says. “And it takes all kinds of people. For instance, I’m an introvert. I’m social-\n', 'ly awkward. And I’m not a great public speaker. But that doesn’t mean I don’t \n', ' 48\n', 'lead, just because I don’t fit the traditional description of a leader. The point is, \n', 'it doesn’t matter who you are or what you look like.

4,Joel Enrique Peña Panichine,Hope From The Ends Of The Earth,49,53,"['Hope From The Ends Of The Earth\n', 'Joel Enrique Peña Panichine | Chile\n', 'Joel Peña remembers the first time he felt a real connection to the ocean. As \n', 'a child he would join his grandfather on his two-week fishing expeditions along \n', '49\n', 'the coast of Chile. One day, as the boat was pulling away from the wharf and \n', 'into the ocean, a dolphin swam by. It came so close to the boat that Joel could \n', 'practically reach out and touch it. “How wonderful!” he shouted. Now he’s 20 \n', 'years old; but still, every time he sees a dolphin, Joel says, “It reminds me of my \n', 'connection to nature.”\n', 'Joel grew up in the southeastern part of Chile, in two different regions that \n', 'experience climate extremes. Until he was eight years old, his family lived in \n', 'Chaiten, a small town of about 4,000 people. Then in 2008, the eruption of a \n', 'long-dormant volcano forced them to flee. They ended up on the island of Las \n', 'Islas Chiloe, on the edge of Patagonia, often called “the end of the earth.”\n', 'The big island of Chiloe is like something out of a dream: colorful houses \n', 'rise up on stilts in the water along the shore. Behind them are lush, green forests. \n', 'Here, about 40,000 people live in an area of just under 4,000 square miles.\n', 'As a curious child, Joel began exploring the incredible biodiversity of the \n', 'island. On Chiloe, the animals have to adapt to the extreme conditions, which \n', 'makes them remarkably diverse, and unique. There’s the pudu, the world’s smallest \n', 'deer; and the monito del monte, a marsupial the size of a mouse that exists only \n', 'in Chile and Argentina. In the summers, magnificent blue whales—the world’s \n', 'largest mammals—migrate through the coastal waters of southern Chile. “We \n', 'live in a place that’s so privileged with biodiversity,” Joel says. “There are tons of \n', 'beautiful species, and flowers too. You start to internalize that nature.”\n', 'Over the years, Joel has seen how human activity is causing harm to some \n', 'species, and throwing off the balance of the ecosystem. The Chilean dolphin, \n', 'which so inspired Joel when he was a kid, is listed as “near threatened” by the \n', 'International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Today, only about 5,000 \n', 'Chilean dolphins remain in the wild.\n', 'For years, the population of dolphins off the coast of Chile has been cut \n', 'down by overfishing, and pollution from ships carrying heavy containers filled \n', 'with industrial goods.\n', 'As is the case for the Chilean dolphin, for many of the marine and terrestrial \n', 'animals that live in Chile climate change is not even the greatest threat to their \n', 'livelihoods. Humans are. And for Joel, the only way to save the wide diversity of \n', 'animals that have made the extreme southern coasts of Chile their home—re-\n', 'gardless of whether they live on land or in the sea—is through education, on both \n', 'a local and a global scale.\n', 'That’s why Joel has made it his life’s mission to bring global awareness to \n', 'the environmental and human forces threatening biodiversity in Chiloe. He’s also \n', ' 50\n', 'committed to educating his local community. “People just aren’t aware about their \n', 'impact, or about how to take care of their environment,” he says. “We want peo-\n', 'ple to understand, and to really dig down to see the roots of the problems.”\n', 'Joel is the perfect emissary for his island community. Like much of the local \n', 'population of the Islas Chiloe, Joel comes from a Mapuche Indigenous back-\n', 'ground. He knew that in order to have the biggest impact, he would have to speak \n', 'with Indigenous leaders in each of the main cities and towns on the Big Island \n', '(Isla Grande). But he also knew he would have to bring his message to a global \n', 'audience.\n', 'That is why in 2019 Joel joined the Chilean branch of the global Fridays \n', 'for Future movement. In December he represented his people at the COP 25 \n', 'Conference in Madrid. There he joined with other youth leaders to call on world \n', 'leaders to do much more to protect marine ecosystems and respect human rights. \n', 'He was critical of his own country, where the economy has been prioritized over \n', 'the well-being of its people: where even basic goods like water aren’t free, but have \n', 'been privatized.\n', 'Returning from Madrid, Joel was inspired to found his own nongovernmen-\n', 'tal organization, along with 15 other young conservationists. They call it Chiloe \n', 'Protegido (Chiloe Protected), and they have developed creative ways of speaking \n', 'to the local populations about how they can work together to protect the island’s \n', 'biodiversity.\n', 'They’ve organized beach cleanups to remove plastic from the beaches. To \n', 'offset the loss of the island’s one animal rehabilitation center, which is no longer \n', 'active, they’re planning a training program to prepare aspiring conservationists \n', 'to treat wounded or sick animals. And they developed a phone app called Dón-\n', 'deLaViste? (Where Did You See It?) that allows users to describe the wildlife they \n', 'encounter in their daily lives, both on land and at sea.\n', 'But increasingly, Joel is focusing his efforts on marine conservation. Inspired \n', 'by Sylvia Earle’s Mission Blue, through which ocean “hope spots” are selected to \n', 'be protected, Joel wants to create a global youth movement aimed at protecting \n', 'the oceans.\n', 'For Joel, human activity is just one threat to marine ecosystems. Warmer \n', 'ocean temperatures, which lead to ocean acidification, have a devastating impact \n', 'on species like whales and dolphins. And the algae that blooms in warmer waters \n', 'leads to a phenomenon called marea roja, or red tide, which can be deadly for \n', 'marine animals.\n', 'There are other silent killers too, like radar waves from boats that disrupt \n', '51\n', 'the migratory and communication patterns of whales. More than three-quarters \n', 'of the blue whales that die don’t end up washing up on shores, meaning that the \n', 'death toll is probably a lot higher than we know.\n', 'The challenges can seem enormous, but Joel knows that he doesn’t have to \n', 'tackle them all on his own. “At Chiloe Protegido, we work together, at sea and on \n', 'the earth.

The sky over her home was a mixture of \n', 'brown and gray smoke. The air was thick with particulate, and had been at var-\n', 'ious times throughout the bushfire season of 2019- 2020. The world watched in \n', 'horror, most people powerless to do anything. Some celebrities gave money. And \n', 'firefighters came from all over to fight the fires.\n', 'Thankfully Jean, a 15-year-old youth climate activist, didn’t lose anything \n', 'precious, like so many others had. “I’ve been fortunate, but I know so many others \n', 'who haven’t been,” she says. One of her fellow activists was evacuated shortly be-\n', 'fore her 18th birthday party. “By the end of the night, their home was destroyed. \n', 'It just goes to show that when dealing with the climate crisis, things can change \n', 'in a flash.”\n', 'Sadly, Australia has become a tinderbox. The last devastating outbreak of \n', 'bushfires began in September 2019, and lasted for months. This is mainly the \n', 'result of increased temperatures, a severe drought, and the inability to fight fires \n', 'by “backburning” in these conditions. Almost all of Australia was affected, with \n', 'fires raging across the country, including in Tasmania.

I saw an ad on Twitter asking for volunteers. As a believer \n', 'in the cause, I joined. I handed out pamphlets and flyers, and made cold calls \n', 'to people.

She imme-\n', 'diately got involved with other young people and activist groups, including the             \n', '#StopAdani campaign.\n', '#StopAdani was protesting the construction of the Adani coal mine in \n', 'Queensland, which was to be the largest coal mining operation in the southern \n', 'hemisphere. It would impact the environment in a variety of ways. The min-\n', 'ing site overlapped with one of the last remaining habitats of the endangered \n', 'black-throated finch. There would be an inevitable cost to Australia’s coral reefs \n', 'as well, since most of the coal would be shipped near the reefs on its way out \n', 'of Australia to be used by developing countries.

But this one was very local, which made it easy for the \n', 'average Australian to get behind.”\n', 'Around the time Jean was involved with #StopAdani, a friend of hers sent \n', 'her a link to the School Strike 4 Climate website in October 2018. This movement \n', 'had three main demands for the Australian government: no new sources of fossil \n', 'fuels; transition to fully renewable energy by 2030; and the creation of a just \n', 'transition plan for workers currently employed in the fossil fuel industry.\n', '“At that point, few people knew about what Greta Thunberg was doing,” \n', 'Jean says. “But in Australia, the youth were inspired. In Castlemaine, a small \n', 'town near Melbourne, a few girls who read about Greta in The Guardian took up \n', 'the cause. They knew they had to bring this message to Australia somehow and \n', 'were in the process of organizing a strike in their capital city, Melbourne. I sent \n', 'them an email, saying I want to make this happen in in my capital city, Sydney. I \n', 'got their support, which was great, but it was also a lot of pressure. I’d never done \n', 'anything on this scale!

Her life seemed to be going \n', 'great, but then, when she was 22, Julia survived a horrible car crash. That expe-\n', 'rience changed her outlook on life. “The crash woke me up to the importance \n', 'of the moment,” she says. “I wanted to do whatever I could to make a positive \n', 'impact on the future.”\n', 'Julia first entered the ancient redwood forests in the small community of \n', 'Stafford, Washington: and she was instantly overwhelmed with the beauty and \n', 'spirituality of the place. She had learned that these redwood trees were being \n', 'cut down for timber by a company called the Pacific Lumber Company. “When \n', 'I found out that they were being destroyed, I knew that I had to do something to \n', 'try and protect them,” she said.\n', '“Luna” was a beautiful, majestic tree that had stood high atop a steep ridge \n', 'for 1,500 years and was 180 feet tall. The branches of this tree had grown in \n', 'curves and twists, which was probably what saved it from the chainsaws in the \n', 'first place: when the trees of the area were cut down for timber, the mills couldn’t \n', 'handle such an unevenly-grown tree.\n', '57\n', 'But now the famous tree was marked with blue paint, tagging it to be cut \n', 'down in December 1997. And people were protesting: activists were taking turns \n', 'staying in the trees, to keep the chainsaws from cutting them down. The organiz-\n', 'ers were looking for someone willing to spend more than just a couple of hours: \n', 'they wanted someone to stay a full week in one of the trees. “Nobody else would \n', 'volunteer,” says Julia. “So they had to pick me.”\n', 'Ever since she was a child, Julia has stood up for what she believes in. When \n', 'she was attacked by a group of teenage boys in the parking lot of a fast-food \n', 'restaurant, she knew she had to press charges, even though she also knew she \n', 'would have to face them again, in school. This experience taught her that there is \n', 'no backing down from what you believe to be right.\n', 'And Julia was convinced that cutting down these ancient trees was very \n', 'wrong. “How can we cut something like this down, and not think that we’re af-\n', 'fecting something much deeper than ourselves?” she says.\n', 'And so, on December 10, 1997, Julia began her attempt to save Luna. She \n', 'and a crew of eight fellow activists hoisted provisions to the top of the tree using \n', 'a pulley system. “After an hour and a half, we got the last of the provisions up. By \n', 'then it was midnight. Finally, I was able to put on the harness and ascend Luna. It \n', 'seemed an exhausting eternity before I reached the top,” she remembers. “When \n', 'I finally got to the top, I untangled myself from the harness and looked around for \n', 'a place to collapse.” Then she looked around at what would be her home for the \n', 'next week—the 6-by-6-foot platform where she was to live—and she prepared her \n', 'first meal on a little camping cooker.\n', 'But once she was in the tree, Julia realized that she was fighting for some-\n', 'thing much bigger than the survival of a single tree. “From up there, I was able to \n', 'see everything we stand for, and everything we struggle against every single day,” \n', 'she says. “I could see the beautiful forests stretching out; I could see snowcapped \n', 'mountains in the distance; I could even see the ocean.”\n', 'Whenever she would look out at the ocean, she would also see the Pacific \n', 'Lumber mill, the very factory that was planning on cutting down the tree that \n', 'she was living in. Looking out at all that natural beauty, Julia made a decision. “I \n', 'had to give my word to Luna, and to the forest; to myself, and to the world,” she \n', 'says. “I decided I wouldn’t come to the ground again until I had done everything \n', 'I possibly could to make the world aware, and to bring about some change.”\n', 'On her little platform 180 feet above ground, the days turned into weeks, \n', 'and the weeks turned into months. But Julia had given her word that she wouldn’t \n', 'come to the ground until the redwood trees were safe, and she intended to keep \n', ' 58\n', 'her promise. Meanwhile, all around her, the logging continued.\n', '“There were miles upon miles of clear-cuts, as far as the eye can see,” she \n', 'says. “During the time I was up there more and more trees were destroyed, until \n', 'eventually I was surrounded by clear-cuts.” Sadly, today, only about 5 percent of \n', 'the historic redwood forests remain.\n', 'While living in the tree, Julia reflected on her traumatic childhood experi-\n', 'ences. She was used to overcoming obstacles, and she was willing to make sacrific-\n', 'es. Local people from environmental organizations jerry-rigged a pulley system to \n', 'deliver food and water to her. In winter, to keep warm she wore two pairs of socks, \n', 'two pairs of thermal pants, and wool pants, with ski pants over that. She also wore \n', 'two thermal T-shirts, a sweater, two windbreakers, and a raincoat. “I was getting \n', 'close to being as wide as I am tall, but it worked,” she says, laughing. To warm up \n', 'she would prepare hot tea on her little gas stove.\n', 'Besides the cold, Julia had to deal with harassment by Pacific Lumber. For \n', 'them, she was a serious problem, interfering with their ability to finish their job. \n', 'So they tried various methods of getting rid of her: they posted an eviction notice \n', 'at the bottom of the tree, and they even flew helicopters close to the platform \n', 'where she was living, hoping that the wind from the rotor blades would blow her \n', 'out of the tree. But Julia stayed put. She lived on the top of that tree for 738 days.\n', '“This old growth forest that is being cut down won’t come back,” Julia says. \n', '“If we hadn’t protected Luna, this world would never again have a Luna.”\n', 'The clear-cuts around Luna were causing other environmental problems \n', 'too. After cutting all of the trees in an area, the loggers would burn the soil using \n', 'chemicals. And without the trees to hold the topsoil, rain would wash the earth \n', 'downhill, causing chemical-infested mudslides. The chemicals then ended up in \n', 'the streams and rivers, causing irreversible damage to the environment.\n', 'In 1999, after two years of living in the tree, an agreement was finally \n', 'reached with Pacific Lumber. The lumber company agreed that Luna and all \n', 'trees within a 200-foot buffer zone around it would be preserved. And they had \n', 'raised $50,000 in donations to finance research about sustainable forestry at \n', 'Humboldt State University.\n', 'On December 18, 1999, Julia climbed down the tree and, for the first time \n', 'in more than two years, set foot on the ground.

7,Felix Finkbeiner,Plant-For-The-Planet,61,64,"['Plant-For-The-Planet\n', 'Felix Finkbeiner | Germany\n', 'Felix Finkbeiner was standing behind the stage at the United Nations. He \n', 'was about to speak in the UN General Assembly Hall, on the very podium that is \n', 'normally used by the presidents, prime ministers, and chancellors of the world. “I \n', 'was incredibly nervous,” Felix says. “Right before I went on stage, I just wished I \n', 'was in school.” That is quite an unusual wish for a 13-year-old.\n', 'In the audience was a woman who was very special to Felix. Her name was \n', 'Wangari Maathei. She was an environmental activist, and the first female profes-\n', 'sor in the East African nation of Kenya. For the past 30 years, she had worked \n', 'together with local communities to plant 30 million trees in African countries. \n', '“These trees had provided many women with their own income for the first time, \n', 'and protected the soil from erosion. But they also store carbon,” Felix says. “Every \n', 'tree extracts CO2 from the atmosphere.”\n', 'When Felix was five years old, he had gotten a present that he really loved. \n', 'It was a stuffed animal, a polar bear that was almost as big as he was at the time. \n', 'When, four years later, he had to give a presentation in elementary school about \n', 'the climate crisis, he immediately realized the gravity of the situation: because he \n', 'knew that polar bears were being threatened by rising temperatures and melting \n', 'snowcaps.\n', 'For his presentation, he tried to learn about possible solutions to the climate \n', 'crisis. That is when he first read about Wangari Maathei. Inspired by the work \n', 'she was doing planting trees in Kenya, at the end of his presentation Felix came \n', 'up with a proposition for his classmates: “Let’s plant one million trees in every \n', 'country on earth!” he said. That was in 2007, and it was the beginning of his \n', 'organization, Plant-for-the- Planet.\n', 'A couple of weeks after his presentation, Felix and his classmates planted \n', 'their first trees. Two local journalists reported on the event, and other schools \n', '61\n', 'heard about it and decided to join in. “Someone built a little website for us,” Felix \n', 'remembers. “It was basically a ranking of who had planted the most trees.”\n', 'Soon more schools joined the effort, and it became a competition: and one \n', 'year later the students had planted 50,000 trees. After three years they hit one \n', 'million! That is how Plant-for-the-Planet started to grow.\n', 'New studies show that planting trees is the most effective way to absorb the \n', 'harmful greenhouse gas CO2 from the atmosphere. “Trees are fantastic, because \n', 'they are the only machines we have that can absorb the CO2 we emit,” Felix says. \n', '“Every tree that we plant absorbs about 10 kilos of CO2 per year.”\n', 'With our current levels of emissions, that means that we have to plant a lot \n', 'of trees. And that is why Felix came up with a very ambitious goal: he and his \n', 'organization, Plant-for-the-Planet, are mobilizing the world to plant and restore \n', 'a trillion trees.\n', 'A trillion is a thousand billions—an almost unimaginable number.\n', 'But planting such a large number of trees is not only good for the climate: it \n', 'has other positive effects too. “When we plant trees, it helps to slow down deserti-\n', 'fication; it protects biodiversity; and it creates jobs,” Felix says.\n', 'Trees that are planted in tropical regions are particularly helpful. They grow \n', 'much faster than in other parts of the world, so they can absorb more CO2, and \n', 'they can do it sooner. The tropical regions of Latin America, Africa, and South-\n', 'east Asia also have the greatest amount of potential area for planting new trees.\n', 'And so, in March 2015, Plant-for-the-Planet started planting trees in the \n', 'Yucatan peninsula, in Mexico. Each tree they plant can absorb up to 200 kilos of \n', 'CO2 in only two decades—and they have already planted more than 6 million \n', 'trees. Their ambitious goal is to plant a million additional trees every year, and to \n', 'look after each plant, to make sure that it is thriving. Of course, they need a lot of \n', 'workers for this project. “In Yucatan we are already the biggest employer,” Felix \n', 'says, proudly.\n', 'According to a new study by scientists at ETH University in Zürich, Switzer-\n', 'land, there is plenty of available space on the earth for planting trees. In fact, they \n', 'have calculated that the amount of available space is equal to an area as big as the \n', 'United States of America.\n', '“All around the globe, there are large areas that can be reforested,” Felix \n', 'says. “Of course, global reforestation is not the only solution to the climate crisis.” \n', 'Another important factor, he says, is educating young people to stand up for them-\n', 'selves and argue for the importance of fighting the climate crisis. “So we began to \n', ' 62\n', 'offer academies,” Felix says. “The core idea is: we teach each other.”\n', 'In the academies, children learn how to give speeches and, of course, how \n', 'to plant trees. To date, Plant-for-the-Planet has organized more than 1,600 such \n', 'academies, and trained more than 91,000 children and youth in 75 countries. \n', '“Whoever dares to, later gives speeches to entrepreneurs, governments, and other \n', 'children, to get them on board,” Felix says.\n', 'Of course, planting a trillion trees is a very ambitious goal. That is why Fe-\n', 'lix, along with other Climate Justice Ambassadors from the Plant- for-the-Planet \n', 'academies, decided to work together to come up with innovative ways to do this. \n', '“What would Wangari Maathai do today, to connect people who want to plant \n', 'trees around the world?” they asked themselves. And the answer they came up \n', 'with was that probably she would develop an app.\n', 'Their idea was simple: just like when Plant-for-the-Planet first started, and \n', 'schools had competed with each other to see who could plant the most trees, they \n', 'decided that people worldwide should be able to share their tree-planting success-\n', 'es with each other.\n', '“So in 2019, we launched our Plant-for-the-Planet app,” Felix says. “It’s \n', 'amazing how much people like it, and how many people use it to plant trees! \n', 'Today there are more than a hundred tree planting projects on the app. But we \n', 'want to have hundreds.”\n', 'Of course, Felix and his fellow activists are fighting against time. Every year, \n', 'the world is losing around 10 billion trees per year. “Deforestation is the worst in \n', 'Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia,” Felix says. And while there are positive trends \n', 'in Malaysia and Indonesia, the current government of Brazil has actually weak-\n', 'ened many of the protections of the Amazon forest. “Still, in principle we’re \n', 'making progress when it comes to the protection of our forests,” Felix says.\n', '“There are many reasons to be disappointed when it comes to climate poli-\n', 'cies,” he says. “But slowly we are moving forward. It is a very important step that \n', 'with the Paris Climate Agreement we now have a common goal, and all of the \n', 'countries have made clear what their contribution will be.”\n', 'It is projects like Felix’s that have raised global awareness of the importance \n', 'of trees in the fight against climate change. To date about 14 billion trees have \n', 'been reported to the tree counter; and they now have 75,000 members. “Planting \n', 'trees is the easiest thing that we can do to alleviate the climate crisis, and everyone \n', 'can contribute,” Felix says.\n', 'Before she passed away in 2011, Wangari Maathai had started the One \n', '63\n', 'Billion Trees Campaign. Now it is up to the next generation to continue her legacy. \n', '“We took it to the next level,” says Felix. “It is now the One Trillion Trees Cam-\n', 'paign.

Now the 18-year-old is worried. “This year, it didn’t \n', 'snow even once,” he explains. “Winters hover around 25 C (77 F), which is just \n', 'hard to comprehend.”\n', 'Born in the countryside outside Turin, David grew up with rivers running \n', 'through lovely farmlands, and views of the snowcapped Alps. His rural upbringing \n', ' 64\n', 'gave him a deep sense of responsibility for protecting its natural beauty. Agricul-\n', 'tural regions like his in Northern Italy are suffering some of the greatest negative \n', 'impacts of climate change. “With the reduced snowpack, we are susceptible to \n', 'droughts,” he says, “We’re facing serious situations, especially in our agricultural \n', 'areas.”\n', 'Northern Italy’s farms are famous for producing the luscious tomatoes used \n', 'in its tasty pasta sauces and pizzas. In the next few decades, this whole region is \n', 'at risk of having a sustainable source of drinking water. “50 percent of the ice is \n', 'already gone from the glaciers in the Alps,” David says. “And 70 percent of that \n', '50 percent has thawed in just the last 10 years. If it keeps up at this pace, we won’t \n', 'have a reliable source of water in the future. And the North is the most populated \n', 'region of Italy. It’s a scary thing to consider.”\n', 'In high school, David had learned about climate change. So he was shocked \n', 'to see that Italy’s leaders weren’t doing anything about it. That’s when he started \n', 'looking for youth leaders who were changemakers in their countries.\n', '“I saw Greta’s speech to the European Parliament, and I thought, this girl \n', 'my age is speaking in front of all of our European leaders. I was so inspired. I \n', 'immediately started learning about #FridaysForFuture. Then one day I said, okay, \n', 'let’s try it!”\n', 'For the first Friday event David’s parents didn’t allow him to attend. “‘You’re \n', 'not skipping school to go on the street with some strangers,’ they said. In the \n', 'beginning, they weren’t so sure about what I was doing,” David explains. “They \n', 'thought I was wasting my time, instead of studying and pursuing hobbies.” But af-\n', 'ter they saw his dedication, they changed their minds. “By the second week, I was \n', 'able to convince them,” he says. “Now they are both a part of #ParentsForFuture, \n', 'the parents’ side of the movement.”\n', 'A few weeks later, as David marched down the streets of old Turin, he was \n', 'amazed to see the gathering masses of people. His #FridaysForFuture group had \n', 'chosen Piazza Vittorio as their meeting spot. Turin’s largest piazza, it can hold \n', '100,000 people. Suddenly, their forward progress was stopped in its tracks. “We \n', 'struggled to get past all the people,” David says. “It was full by the time we arrived. \n', 'I couldn’t believe it!”\n', 'Along the way, their march was stopped again by an energetic group of \n', 'young people: and for a moment, it was a somewhat tense situation. But quick-\n', 'ly David realized that they were not being slowed down by detractors, but by a \n', 'swelling crowd of unexpected supporters – tens of thousands of them! No one, in-\n', 'cluding himself, could believe so many people had gathered to support this cause.\n', '65\n', '“When we arrived, the entire plaza was filled up, just like the streets. Can \n', 'you imagine? To think that we were able to achieve that much support, and raise \n', 'that much awareness. We were just a group of 30 young people or so, and we had \n', 'brought 150,000 people into the streets of Turin, in solidarity with our cause.”\n', 'What David’s success story really proves is the power that tech- savvy youth \n', 'can have in the environmental conversation. David is a programmer and skillful \n', 'social media campaigner, both skills that have enormous potential for any move-\n', 'ment trying to gain traction in the internet age—particularly when they have the \n', 'underlying support of innovative organizations like #FridaysForFuture.\n', 'From his position as a social media influencer, David joined with other youth \n', 'leaders in creating a global awakening to our climate emergency. These dynamic \n', 'youth leaders immersed in technology are reaching out with this urgent message—\n', 'and coming together to wake us all up.

Once young people learn, we can get them to take action.”\n', 'For youth who want to get involved in a climate cause, David has some \n', 'suggestions to help them navigate the obstacles they will surely face. “I think it’s \n', 'important to send a message that they should never give up the fight. When you’re \n', 'in a movement like this, and the message is critical, it can be very stressful. It’s \n', 'common among activists to experience an overwhelming sense of wanting to give \n', 'up. I myself have had many moments of frustration where I’ve thought, ‘Nobody \n', 'cares about the climate emergency. The politicians don’t care. I should just give \n', 'up.’ But it’s in these moments most of all when we must support one another. \n', 'The future can only be saved in the present. Coming together as a supportive \n', 'community is the most effective way forward.”\n', 'In fact it’s the urgency of the climate situation that can often be the hardest \n', 'thing to get across to other young people. “It’s fundamental that we start acting \n', 'now. But our institutions are lagging. So it’s important for us to keep up the pres-\n', 'sure, and introduce new levels of awareness to those in charge who aren’t acting, \n', 'or who don’t feel the urgency of the situation that we do.”\n', 'David is also setting his sights on bridging the knowledge and priorities gaps \n', 'between generations in this community. “The older generations pioneered the \n', 'climate movement in Italy, so there is much to learn from them. But there are also \n', ' 66\n', 'a lot of new and exciting ideas coming from the youth movements–and urgency is \n', 'the most visible. A lot of older people haven’t thought about the climate crisis the \n', 'way we have. They don’t think this situation is going to affect them as immediately \n', 'as we believe it is going to–but in fact, older people can be more susceptible to the \n', 'immediate effects of climate change in many ways.” David fears for their future. \n', '“Older people are really more susceptible to the effects of climate change,” he says. \n', '“This year alone, because of the heat waves, Turin had more than 4,000 deaths. \n', 'Most of the people who were affected by the heat are older people. It really shows \n', 'how our climate emergency affects everyone; so we should come together across \n', 'groups to fight this battle.”\n', 'David also thinks it’s essential to educate the older community about the \n', 'connection between climate action and social justice, which is central to making \n', 'a positive change. “It’s up to us as youth, who are more versed in these things, to \n', 'clarify a major component of our activism: climate justice doesn’t mean anything \n', 'without social justice. If we don’t recognize that by now, then we have already \n', 'failed.” He pauses, then adds, “It’s not a fight between us and somebody else. It \n', 'should be an effort fought by all humanity together. For our own survival. Lifting \n', 'up one group, or race, or demographic, doesn’t mean we are making an enemy of \n', 'the others. That sort of thinking must be left in the past. It’s not productive at all. \n', 'Helping anyone is helping everyone. Together is the only way through this climate \n', 'emergency; together to a brighter future.”\n', 'Today David is preparing for college.

They found a report by the environmental organiza-\n', 'tion Greenpeace that listed companies whose practices were particularly harmful \n', 'to the environment: it included Pepsi and Nestlé—and also Kellogg’s.\n', 'So, together with their mom, they decided to take action. They started a \n', 'petition on change.org, calling on Kellogg’s to stop destroying the rainforest for \n', 'palm oil.\n', '“We love orangutans,” the petition reads. “And we were really upset when we \n', 'saw that the numbers of orangutans that are being killed and orphaned every year \n', 'are being increased by companies who want cheap palm oil; it has to stop now!”\n', 'The sisters sent their petition to friends and family, and they gathered about \n', '10 signatures on the first day. “It was a really slow start,” Jia says. But luck was on \n', 'their side.\n', 'Around the same time, a UK supermarket called Iceland teamed up with \n', 'Greenpeace to create a TV ad about palm oil, but it was banned for breaching \n', 'political advertising rules, and an uproar followed. “After that, our petition liter-\n', 'ally exploded,” says Asha. “When we went on holiday there were maybe 15,000 \n', 'signatures. And then when we came back it was like 200,000!”\n', 'Soon the media started to get interested in their story. The sisters were in-\n', 'terviewed by newspapers and even invited onto a radio show. With the number of \n', 'signatures on the petition constantly growing, Kellogg’s finally decided they had \n', 'to react. So they invited Asha and Jia to come to a meeting.\n', 'Together with their mom, the sisters travelled to the company’s headquar-\n', 'ters in Manchester. It was a bit nerve-wracking to meet all of the company’s exec-\n', 'utives in their impressive, 12-story glass tower, Asha remembers. At the Kellogg’s \n', 'headquarters there is free cereal for all employees—and visitors. But Asha and Jia \n', 'weren’t impressed by the fancy building, or the free cornflakes they were given.\n', '“The first thing they said to us was ‘What do you know about Kellogg’s?’” \n', 'Asha remembers. She kept a cool head as she calmly replied, “I know that you use \n', '69\n', '23 of the 26 worse palm oil suppliers.” With that, the atmosphere of the meeting \n', 'changed immediately: the executives had hoped to talk about their brand, their \n', 'company’s growth, and their social service activities, but Asha had instantly, and \n', 'deftly, changed the conversation.\n', '“As soon as we got home from that first meeting, we had two interviews,” \n', 'Jia says. News stations wanted to cover any upcoming meetings, but Kellogg’s \n', 'wouldn’t allow it, explaining that they weren’t a very public company.\n', 'It was the same reason they gave for not publicly supporting Wilmar, an \n', 'important purchaser of palm oil that had come under pressure from Greenpeace, \n', 'and as a result had recently announced more sustainable business practices. A \n', 'public statement by Kellogg’s in support of more sustainable practices would have \n', 'sent an important message. But at their second meeting with Asha and Jia, it \n', 'became clear that Kellogg’s wasn’t willing to take a stand.\n', '“It must have been embarrassing for them,” says Asha. “We travelled all the \n', 'way to meet with them, and it was for nothing, just for them to tell us that they \n', 'hadn’t done anything,” Jia says.\n', 'In the meantime, the number of signatures on the petition kept rising; at \n', 'the time of this writing the number had climbed to over 900,000. Eventually, the \n', 'bosses at Kellogg’s had no choice: they had to do something.\n', 'So they called a third meeting with the young changemakers, and this time \n', 'they delivered—at least on paper. They pledged that until 2025 they would switch \n', 'entirely to using segregated palm oil, which is a more sustainable product. They \n', 'also launched a Global Deforestation policy that will help to mitigate deforesta-\n', 'tion. And they promised to enlist the help of nongovernmental organizations like \n', 'Greenpeace to ensure that their policy is being implemented on the ground.\n', '“But they need to actually do it!” Jia emphasizes. And she says that she and \n', 'her sister will stick to their guns. They plan to meet with the executives at Kellogg’s \n', 'regularly, to make sure that the company is fulfilling their promises. “We need to \n', 'make sure that they are doing what they said they were going to do,” says Asha. \n', '“So, it’s not just us coming by and them saying ‘Oh we haven’t done anything,’ and \n', 'then extending the deadline even more.”\n', 'Besides holding Kellogg’s to account, Asha and Jia have other big plans. \n', 'After all, there are a lot of other companies that use palm oil in their products, \n', 'without regard to the impact on the environment and on local populations.\n', '“We are thinking about who we are going to contact next,” says Jia. “We \n', 'were considering Nestle or Pepsi.”\n', ' 70\n', 'Until these companies change their harmful practices, there are things that \n', 'everyone can do to help, Asha says. Learning about the ingredients used in the \n', 'products we consume is important, and wherever possible one should try not to \n', 'buy products that use palm oil.\n', 'Since the sisters have discovered the horrible effects of palm oil production, \n', 'buying gifts for their parents has become a lot more difficult.

He’d seen the youth- led \n', 'movement around the world growing, with people marching by the hundreds, \n', 'thousands, and even millions. But in Russia, striking en masse, unlike in other coun-\n', 'tries, is against the law. If there is more than one person, they must be approved \n', 'by the government.\n', 'So he stood for the climate alone because he had to.\n', 'Arshak hadn’t always been solo in his stand. In fact, his introduction to cli-\n', 'mate activism had been just a few days earlier, on March 15. Inspired by Greta \n', 'Thunberg’s global FridaysforFuture movement, a small group of activists had \n', 'gathered in “Hyde Park,” a small section of Sokolniki Park, far from the center of \n', 'Moscow. Since not very many people go there, that was the place the government \n', 'had assigned to them on their permit.\n', 'There, about 50-70 activists—mostly young people—gathered to send out a \n', 'call to Russia’s leaders, asking them to do more to protect the environment. After \n', 'all, Russia is the world’s fourth biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. And the activists \n', 'were painfully aware of the myriad ways climate change is affecting Russia. There \n', 'are forest fires in Siberia; there is flooding in the Irkutsk region that is melting the \n', 'Arctic permafrost. That in turn destabilizes biodiversity, and creates a feedback \n', 'loop that leads to further global warming.\n', ' 72\n', 'Standing in an out-of-the way park just wasn’t enough for Arshak. He knew \n', 'that protesting in a preapproved place, far away from those who most needed to \n', 'hear their message, wasn’t going to attract enough attention. So he decided to \n', 'venture out on his own and take the message to the public in a bold new way.\n', '“What can I do to support FridaysforFuture in Moscow?” he wondered. He \n', 'thought about it, and researched the laws about single-person strikes. “It seemed \n', 'like that was the only way,” he says. Then he chose to stage his solo protests in \n', 'Pushkin Square because it is one of the most frequented plazas not just in Russia, \n', 'but in the world.\n', '“After that, I started to strike by myself in Moscow’s city center, where lots of \n', 'people could see my protest,” he says. “I thought maybe they would be inspired if \n', 'they saw me there with my sign every week,” he explains. And he adds, “As fellow \n', 'Russians, they knew that I was risking a lot by striking openly, and talking about \n', 'it openly.”\n', 'Next, in solidarity with other global youth climate activists, and in order \n', 'to share his message with other Russian youth, Arshak started posting photos \n', 'on social media. He was fully aware of the risk he was taking; everything from \n', 'being arrested, to doing jail time or getting a heavy fine, or even being subjected \n', 'to physical violence.\n', 'Soon people around the world began to notice his protests. One of them was \n', 'Greta Thunberg, who began to follow him on Twitter and retweet his messages.\n', 'His solo protests began to morph into a shared experience, as the internet \n', 'and young activists across Russia and around the world took notice. Then other \n', 'young Russians began to mirror his actions, and the community of climate activ-\n', 'ists in Russia began to grow. “People started to think that maybe it’s okay to do it,” \n', 'he says. “And that it’s not so scary – they started thinking they can do something \n', 'too.”\n', 'In a way, Arshak’s story of solitary activism didn’t really start in Russia. It \n', 'started in the mid-1990s, in Yerevan, Armenia, where he was born. Arshak’s par-\n', 'ents had fled to Russia from their Armenian homeland when he was just a year \n', 'old. They were escaping a 10-year-long armed conflict that had devastated their \n', 'country, reduced neighborhoods to shambles, and destroyed the economy.\n', 'Growing up in Moscow, Arshak had felt a profound sense of isolation. \n', 'School was difficult for him, and other kids picked on him because he was a for-\n', 'eigner. “It’s quite complicated to tell what it is like to live in Moscow,” he says. \n', '“When I was a kid, I faced lots of challenges because I was Armenian.” But instead \n', 'of letting the bullying get him down, Arshak dove headlong into learning music. \n', '73\n', 'He picked up the violin at an early age and began to practice incessantly, learning \n', 'ballads and other tunes. He developed a special affinity for the music of Chopin. \n', 'At the age of nine, he was accepted to an academy for aspiring musicians, where \n', 'he began his classical training.\n', 'And so, throughout his life, Arshak had spent a lot of time alone. Perhaps \n', 'that’s what gave him the determination and the stamina to go through with his \n', 'solo strikes, despite the cold and wind of a Moscow winter, and his fears about \n', 'breaking the law.\n', 'Even when he was still in the Russian school system, Arshak had realized \n', 'the environment wasn’t being studied. In fact, environmental issues weren’t being \n', 'taken seriously at all. Yet Russians have good reason to be concerned about the \n', 'havoc climate change could wreak on their country and its economy. Scientists \n', 'have warned that Russia’s carbon dioxide emissions are warming at a rate twice \n', 'that of the global average. As a world leader in international organizations, and \n', 'with a seat on the United Nations Security Council, Russia has an important voice \n', 'in deciding what the climate’s future will look like.\n', '“Other countries can say, if Russia doesn’t act, then why should we?” Arshak \n', 'says. “So, it’s very important that every country should start acting as if this is a \n', 'crisis, and reduce their emissions dramatically. Now!”\n', 'Arshak began to gain international renown for his activism. He was invited \n', 'to join Greta Thunberg on stage at the 2019 COP 25 conference in Madrid. He \n', 'realized that he might have to spend time in jail when he returned to Russia. But \n', 'from the stage he told the people gathered, “I am not afraid to be arrested. I am \n', 'afraid not to do enough.”\n', 'Upon his return from the conference, Arshak returned to Pushkin Square \n', 'for his strike. This time, he was arrested by the Russian police for staging an \n', 'unlawful “mass protest”—of three people—and sent to prison for six days. As \n', 'everyone knows, Russian prisons are infamous for their treatment of dissidents. \n', 'People were worried about him and his future. Across the country and around the \n', 'world, a wave of support swelled up from his peers.\n', 'Though his prison sentence was intended to slow down the climate move-\n', 'ment in Russia, it had the opposite effect. During each day of his prison sentence, \n', 'crowds gathered outside of Russian embassies in cities around the world to protest. \n', 'Thousands more tweeted and posted messages of support. And after his release, \n', 'the movement came through even stronger than before.\n', 'Arshak was touched by everyone standing up for him. “It’s even helped our \n', 'movement a little bit,” he says. He pauses, then adds, “It’s not so scary to be in jail \n', ' 74\n', 'for six days. It’s more scary not to have a normal future, I think.”\n', 'The more involved he’s become with climate activism, the less lonely Arshak \n', 'feels. The sense of solidarity he feels with other climate activists has even had an \n', 'effect on his everyday life. “Before, I was playing violin, reading books, sitting at \n', 'home and studying, but I was really quite lonely,” he says of his life before joining \n', 'Fridays for Future. “After I became a climate activist, I found a lot of friends, other \n', 'activists who were supporting me, or striking with me. I was so much more lonely \n', 'when I was just a person studying, and living my life.”\n', 'Thanks to Arshak’s efforts the climate movement in Russia is slowly growing, \n', 'in spite of the restrictions on public protesting. They’ve found creative ways to \n', 'get around the limitations imposed by Russia’s authoritarian system. For example, \n', 'during the global climate march in September of 2019, Arshak was joined by \n', 'about 70 other “solo” protesters, who took turns staging their own personal pro-\n', 'tests one by one in Pushkin Square. They organized queues, and as each protestor \n', 'took his or her turn, they would exchange posters, while other protestors stood \n', 'nearby “so we didn’t feel alone.” About 700 people in more than 25 other Russian \n', 'cities joined the climate march.\n', 'Then Arshak organized an online “flash mob” with the hashtag #LetRus-\n', 'siaStrikeForClimate.

They made her prove that her brother was related \n', 'to her—because at that time, in Sudan you could get harassed, or even thrown \n', 'in jail, for being out in public with someone of the opposite gender. “It was really \n', 'terrifying,” she says.\n', 'Everyday life was hard in Sudan. Many young people were not allowed to \n', 'get an education. Lines for bread snaked out of bakeries; people queued at the \n', 'bank to take out money, but came away empty-handed. The police set up check-\n', 'points where they checked for IDs without giving a valid reason why.\n', 'Alaa, and many others in her generation, grew up thirsty for change. They \n', 'watched as other Arab countries were rising up against the dictators who had \n', 'monopolized power for so many years: in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt. But throughout \n', 'this period, Sudan’s dictator, al-Bashir, somehow managed to hang on. He ruled \n', 'over a massacre in the Darfur region that had killed more than 600,000 people. \n', 'And he turned a blind eye to the widespread violence: against women, against the \n', 'press, against defenders of human rights.\n', '“There was a lot of energy piling up inside of me, because that regime was \n', 'full of corruption,” Alaa says, her anger still palpable. “They were killing people! \n', 'There was a lot of hunger, and pain, and rape, and violence. For 30 years! And \n', 'that was when the revolution started.”\n', 'As is often the case in countries that experience conflict and unrest, there \n', 'was a reason for the conflict that no one was talking about: and that “elephant in \n', 'the room” was climate change.\n', 'To many observers and analysts, even some in positions as high up as at the \n', 'United Nations, the war in Sudan’s Darfur region was one of the first modern \n', 'conflicts fought over climate. The Sahel region, where Darfur is located, used to \n', 'be called the breadbasket of Africa, and was known for its lush agricultural lands. \n', 'The Nile River runs through that part of the country, nourishing the region.\n', 'But as climate change has accelerated, the region is drying up: this has led \n', 'to tensions between farmers of different ethnicities who produce crops, and raise \n', 'cattle there. The Sahara Desert has expanded—moving about 60 miles south \n', 'in just 40 years. Rainfall during that time has decreased by 15 to 20 percent. By \n', 'as soon as 2030, just 10 years from now, the main crop produced in the area, \n', 'sorghum, could decrease by 70 percent due to climate change.\n', '81\n', 'It was the food shortages Alaa experienced growing up that eventually led \n', 'her generation to rise up. People were hungry. And these food shortages weren’t \n', 'just a result of corruption—although that played a role—it was also because of \n', 'climate change.\n', 'Alaa saw firsthand how changes in the climate had had an impact on popu-\n', 'lations outside of Khartoum, where she grew up. “Usually the rain would come in \n', 'August, but more recently it would be in June. These changes in the climate have \n', 'affected certain regions,” she says.\n', 'Farmers had to begin to bring their cattle further and further from home in \n', 'order to feed them. Others would have to sell their cattle in exchange for seeds so \n', 'they could grow other crops.\n', '“There have always been problems, but the previous regime was not willing \n', 'to put forward sustainable solutions,” she says.\n', 'The moments during and just after the Sudanese revolution were filled with \n', 'hope for the future. After the military staged the coup that overthrew al-Bachir, \n', 'they eventually settled on a power-sharing agreement with civil society organiza-\n', 'tions and protest groups: a major step toward democracy. Al-Bachir went on trial, \n', 'and was convicted of corruption and sentenced to two years in prison.\n', 'Not all of the promises of peace and stability from the new regime were kept, \n', 'though. In June, security forces shot dead 87 protesters. There were still outbursts \n', 'of violence; but it was nothing compared to what the people had suffered before \n', 'and during the revolution.\n', 'The promises to include more women in politics also fell through, and many \n', 'of the women who had led the movement felt that their voices were once again \n', 'being left out. So in the fall of 2019, Alaa and a group of women activists from \n', 'Sudan traveled to the United Nations in New York City, where they called on \n', 'world leaders to ensure equal gender representation in Sudan’s newly formed \n', 'parliament.\n', 'They’ve received the support of some notable figures, like the actor George \n', 'Clooney and his wife Amal, who denounced the corrupt regime.\n', 'Alaa knows that the fight for justice doesn’t end when the dictator falls; it \n', 'ends when everyone has an equal chance at success.

13,Parker Liautaud,To The Ends Of The Earth... And Back,84,89,"['To The Ends Of The Earth..And Back\n', 'Parker Liautaud | California & Antarctica\n', 'When he reached the North Pole, climate change activist Parker Liautaud \n', 'realized a daring, Arctic dream—at the age of 16. He isn’t your ordinary Arctic \n', 'explorer. Of course, there aren’t really any ordinary Arctic explorers. But Parker \n', 'doesn’t cut a particularly imposing figure, nor does he fit the archetype one might \n', 'assume when trying to conjure up the image of a heroic figure standing at the \n', 'top of the world. On looks alone, Parker could even be considered unassuming. \n', 'He’s slight of build. Soft-spoken. He has said about himself that he’s “the least \n', 'athletically impressive person ever to visit the poles,” which gives you a glimpse \n', 'into his quirky, light-hearted nature. Parker is humorous, humble, and whenever \n', 'he addresses a crowd, which he often does, he’s always measured in his speech and \n', 'clear in his singular message: it’s his generation’s responsibility to take up the reins \n', 'in the fight against climate change.\n', 'By the age of 17, Parker had already made three separate expeditions to the \n', 'Arctic. His first visit was with the renowned Arctic explorer Robert Swan, who was \n', 'the first person to walk both the North and South Poles. On this expedition, they \n', 'stayed at a base ran entirely on renewable energy sources, which fascinated Parker. \n', 'His initial foray to the Arctic had been in a scientific capacity. Here, his interaction \n', 'with green technology, coupled with seeing the dire situation for himself firsthand, \n', 'lit a fire in Parker that compelled him to get involved in the fight against climate \n', 'change in a much more permanent and impactful way.\n', 'Climate change is affecting the entire planet, but it affects certain areas, like \n', 'the Arctic, disproportionately. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-\n', 'mate Change (IPCC), “Antarctica has experienced air temperature increases of \n', '3°C in the Antarctic Peninsula. Although that might not seem very much, it is 5 \n', 'times the mean rate of global warming.” Understanding the precariousness of the \n', 'situation at hand, the expedition Parker was on set various scientific goals for their \n', ' 84\n', 'visit. Parker himself was involved in gathering the rarest of rare commodities: \n', 'Arctic snow samples. These would ultimately act as a Rosetta Stone of sorts for sci-\n', 'entists the world over, when Parker successfully brought them back to the research \n', 'station. This is because the Tritium in the snow samples acts as a relatively reliable \n', 'oceanic tracer of sorts, and can reveal hidden–and changing—patterns of ocean \n', 'circulation and ventilation that can’t be observed with the naked eye.\n', 'These might seem like larger-than-life responsibilities for someone so young, \n', 'and in a way they are. But that doesn’t change the fact that in most every other \n', 'way, Parker was just the same as any other ordinary teenager.\n', 'As an American student at Eton, an illustrious British boarding school for \n', 'boys, Parker always “felt like an outsider,” which he credits as a driving, if not \n', 'painful force in his development as a socially and environmentally conscious cit-\n', 'izen. His inability to fit in was no secret at Eton. He stood out as an obvious \n', 'foreigner, a culture-shocked teenager trying to adjust to a very different way of life. \n', 'During this period, he laments his “bad social skills” as being the reason he made \n', 'no friends, and subsequently spent a lot of time with his nose to the grindstone, \n', 'intently focused on his studies.\n', 'When Parker returned to school in England, he committed himself to serv-\n', 'ing a greater purpose than his own. He spent his days spreading the word about \n', 'the desperate situation at the poles to anybody he could. It didn’t take long for \n', 'him to realize that not everybody shared his passion for protecting the earth. He \n', 'wrote article after article on global warming, climate change, and stewardship of \n', 'the polar regions, but got little reaction. No one seemed to care about a 15-year \n', 'old’s point of view on these harrowing topics, even with the factual evidence and \n', 'scientific data at hand, backing his stance. So, what was it that was causing his \n', 'message to fall on deaf ears? Did he lack credibility because of his youth? Was it \n', 'political? Perhaps he needed to find someone more dynamic to help him spread \n', 'the message?\n', 'It proved to be a very confusing and disheartening period for Parker, who \n', 'had a quick, curious mind, and rarely struggled to achieve what he wanted to in \n', 'an intellectual sense. He had a message, and it was an important message, but it \n', 'wasn’t getting through. Perhaps idealistically, he thought that the climate situation \n', 'at the poles was so urgent, and indisputable from an evidentiary standpoint, that \n', 'any rational person would share his passion equally. On a personal level, he was \n', 'also struggling to fit in at school during this time, and it seemed to make his efforts, \n', 'which weren’t being received with any enthusiasm, feel all the more isolating and \n', 'meaningless.\n', '85\n', 'Over a century earlier, at the age of 22, Sir Ernest Shackleton had his Eureka \n', 'moment, saying, “I had a dream that someday I would go to the region of ice and \n', 'snow, and go on and on until I came to one of the poles of the earth.” At the age \n', 'of 27 his dream had been realized, when he joined Captain Robert Falcon Scott \n', 'on the now renowned Discovery expedition to Antarctica.\n', 'Ernest Shackleton is noted to have famously said, in the most understated \n', 'fashion, “Difficulties are just things to overcome.” And it would take an individual \n', 'with the cunning and resolve of Parker Liautaud, to come up with a new plan in \n', 'the face of this adversity, to truly make an impact in the expansive world beyond \n', 'the walls of Eton.\n', 'Whether it was on the news or at school, Parker always heard people talking \n', 'about global warming, and how climate change will disproportionately affect the \n', 'next generation. That’s why something has to be done – and now. “We have to \n', 'think about the children,” he recalls hearing someone say, and when he did, his \n', 'natural curiosity took over. If it’s going to affect us, why are we waiting for someone else to \n', 'address the problem? he thought. And that’s when Parker Liautaud, like his forbearer \n', 'Sir Ernest Shackleton before him, had his Eureka moment. He knew that the \n', 'global situation was dire, and that time was running out. More importantly, he’d \n', 'knew that he needed to find a creative way to engage his peers, so as to involve his \n', 'generation in the fight and get them invested in the larger cause. Besides, he didn’t \n', 'see anyone else doing anything but talking about the problem at hand.\n', 'After all, he’d had a rare experience that even the brightest Etonians hadn’t–\n', 'he’d actually seen the perilous Arctic firsthand. He had braved hostile territory. \n', 'He had stayed at a base run on renewables, living in the spirit of the cause he was \n', 'trying to marshal. He had learned about the Arctic’s fragile ecosystem, and its \n', 'unique role in moderating global temperature. He personally had done research \n', 'in service of the region’s protection and felt a kinship to it, even an ownership of it, \n', 'in a sense. So why not take it a step further? If he intended to ask as much of his \n', 'peers, surely he should have the wherewithal to stand up and lead them. Calling \n', 'on his past experiences, and with some careful calculation, he felt it was his respon-\n', 'sibility to do something more daring to increase his reach, that at once would fulfill \n', 'his duty of spreading the message about fighting climate change, while getting the \n', 'attention of his peers. Desperate times call for desperate measures, they say.\n', 'So that very day, Parker Liautaud decided he’d become the youngest person \n', 'in the history of the world to set foot on the geographic North Pole.\n', 'To achieve this goal, Parker enlisted the partnership and guidance of en-\n', 'vironmental campaigner Doug Stoup, with whom he raised all the necessary \n', ' 86\n', 'funding for their trip. This independent fundraising was important to Parker, as \n', 'he didn’t want the tenor of his trip, which was to get a message out to the young \n', 'people of the world about climate change and global warming, to be confused \n', 'with some thrill-seeker’s PR stunt. It would surely be a thrilling expedition, but \n', 'as anyone who has been to polar regions knows, the reality of a trip to the Arctic \n', 'can’t be undertaken with anything but complete and utter reverence for the in-\n', 'numerable dangers that are sure to arise, even for the most seasoned adventurer.\n', 'This is the part of the story where Parker Liautaud found himself at odds \n', 'with his forbearer, Sir Ernest Shackleton, who said, “Superhuman effort isn’t \n', 'worth a damn, unless it achieves results.”\n', 'On Parker and Doug’s attempt to reach the North Pole, their journey was \n', 'cut short just 15 miles short of their destination. The geographic North Pole is \n', 'simply a GPS location in the Arctic Ocean, and in the window of time they ap-\n', 'proached it, shifting polar ice sheets didn’t allow them the opportunity to make \n', 'landfall. For 14 days they waited for a break, but it never came. At last, with \n', 'supplies dwindling, and being no closer to their destination, they decided with \n', 'heavy hearts to abort the mission.\n', 'It pained Parker immensely to fail this way, and to fail so publicly. What \n', 'wore on him the most was not fulfilling his promise to their sponsors, the scientific \n', 'community, and above all, his peers, who he was asking so much of. But ultimately, \n', 'the situation was what it was, and both men had to acknowledge that as far as their \n', 'journey went, the Arctic environment “held complete control over us... and we’d \n', 'have to respect that.” Their superhuman effort wouldn’t yield the desired result. \n', 'To consider, as Shackleton said, that such efforts, that their efforts weren’t worth a \n', 'damn. Or worse, if they were in vain...\n', 'In 2010, Parker Liautaud failed to be the youngest person in the history of \n', 'the world to reach the geographic North Pole. But it was in that moment of failure, \n', '1,000 miles from home and freezing in a torn-up tent in the Arctic, that Parker \n', 'remembered why he was out there – to serve a greater purpose than his own. \n', 'And in that sense, Parker succeeded. News of the 15-year-old explorer’s attempt \n', 'gained a bit of traction, and each time a new set of eyes were trained on his story, \n', 'there was a new opportunity to spread his message about fighting climate change.\n', 'It didn’t take long for Parker’s passion to grab hold of him again. A year \n', 'later, in 2011, Parker did in fact reach the geographic North Pole (though this time, \n', 'there was no record at stake, as he had been beaten by a younger adventurer). \n', 'Shortly thereafter, having conquered what they set out to, he and Doug Stoup \n', 'began to organize what would become The Willis Resilience Expedition, setting \n', '87\n', 'their sights on reaching the other pole. On this expedition, they set a record for \n', 'making the fastest human-powered trek from the coast of Antarctica to the South \n', 'Pole (a 397-mile journey in just 22 days, while trailing a 200-pound pulk). In the \n', 'process, Parker became the youngest man in history to complete the journey to \n', 'the South Pole.\n', 'If it weren’t for the endless stream of videos showcasing Parker addressing \n', 'enthralled audiences at the United Nations Foundation, TED talks, or the Clinton \n', 'Global Initiative, to name a few, it’d be difficult to imagine he’s a leading authority \n', 'on modern polar exploration.

14,Vihaan Agarwal,Turning Trash Into Trees,89,93,"['Turning Trash Into Trees\n', 'Vihaan & Nav Agarwal | India\n', 'Vihaan and his little brother Nav were sitting in the back seat of the car, on \n', 'their way to school. The traffic was dense, as usual, and the air outside was smog-\n', 'gy with exhaust fumes. The polluted air in Delhi had been a problem for Vihaan \n', 'for a long time. Because he had asthma, he often wasn’t allowed to go outside and \n', 'play with his friends. So that day when he opened up the newspaper, one article \n', 'in particular caught his eye.\n', '“I read an article about how India’s largest landfill, the Ghazipur landfill, had \n', 'collapsed and caught fire,” he remembers. “It released really dangerous fumes \n', 'into the atmosphere, as you can imagine.” That day, for the first time, Vihaan \n', 'made a connection between two problems that had always bothered him: Delhi’s \n', 'dismal air quality, and the huge amounts of trash generated each and every day \n', '89\n', 'in the city.\n', 'Delhi’s 19 million people produce around 9,000 tons of solid waste every \n', 'day. Most of the trash ends up in landfills, where it is neither recycled nor disposed \n', 'of correctly. But since many landfills are already overflowing, a lot of trash is \n', 'simply burned in the street. These trash fires release toxic fumes into the air—as \n', 'do the landfills, which also burn on a regular basis. And the gigantic mountains of \n', 'waste also contaminate the groundwater.\n', '“You think about trash being soil contamination, or visual pollution,” Vihaan \n', 'says. “But the connection to air pollution was never there for me—until I found \n', 'out that almost 20 percent of Delhi’s air pollution is directly or indirectly caused \n', 'by trash.”\n', 'Vihaan and his brother Nav decided to first tackle the problem in their own \n', 'home. They started by recording how much trash they were producing. Instead of \n', 'having it collected and brought to one of the landfills, they kept it in their yard for \n', 'one month. “It was a staggering amount,” Vihaan says. “No one would think that \n', 'in just one month you would produce that much waste.”\n', 'Vihaan decided that, at the very least, he didn’t want his own waste to end \n', 'up in the landfill and continue to feed the fires that ultimately were making it hard \n', 'for him—and everyone else—to breathe. He started by segregating it into dry and \n', 'wet waste, which made it much easier to recycle later on. But then, when the trash \n', 'was picked up, Vihaan saw that the workers were simply mixing all of the trash \n', 'together—so his separating work had been in vain.\n', 'But he didn’t give up: instead, he contacted a company that would pick up \n', 'the segregated waste and make sure that it was recycled. However, once again \n', 'they discovered that the company they hired to do the recycling wasn’t doing it \n', 'properly. So they decided to start their own organization, One Step Greener.\n', 'At first, he and his brother did the trash sorting and recycling for just their \n', 'own home—but soon 20 other households were doing it too. “From 20 house-\n', 'holds, it grew to a hundred, in a matter of just two months,” Vihaan says. “We \n', 'had so much waste that we had to hire a truck that went around and took the trash \n', 'to a recycling facility.”\n', 'The next step for One Step Greener was to hire workers to segregate the \n', 'collected trash, which was then sold to companies that use the recycled materials \n', 'to produce new ones. This gives the workers the chance to have a steady income, \n', 'bank accounts, and health insurance.\n', '“Initially our goal was just to survive, and to grow the project as much as \n', ' 90\n', 'possible,” Vihaan says. But today, One Step Greener serves more than 1400 \n', 'households in 14 different neighborhoods, as well as in a few schools and offices \n', 'all over Delhi, and is operating in Gurugram. They have a one-of-a-kind center, \n', 'where people can come and drop off their trash to be recycled. It is also their office. \n', 'They recycle 99 percent of the trash they collect: this saves resources, and is much \n', 'better for the environment than trash that ends up in overflowing landfills.\n', 'But from the very beginning, their work was not only about picking up trash \n', 'and making sure that it is recycled. “What we’ve been able to do is not only to \n', 'provide an essential service, but also set up a zero-cost process,” Vihaan explains. \n', '“We charge for the monthly pick up; and the whole rationale is that if you see the \n', 'amount of trash you’re producing in a month, you will automatically reduce that \n', 'waste.”\n', 'Vihaan has observed this over and over again—especially when it comes to \n', 'plastic waste. When families see the mountains of plastic trash they are producing \n', 'in just one month, they work hard to make sure they produce less of it in the \n', 'following month.\n', 'Their model worked so well that soon their nonprofit organization was ac-\n', 'tually turning a profit. So Vihaan and Nav immediately invested the funds into a \n', 'second project to help improve air quality in Delhi: planting trees. “Right in the \n', 'heart of Delhi, we’ve planted an urban forest,” Vihaan says. “Our vision was to \n', 'create an urban forest, a biodiversity hotspot. We’ve been maintaining it for three \n', 'years now.”\n', 'Their forest covers a very small area, but it is home to a large number of \n', 'species: butterflies flutter through the air, and a dozen species of birds are nesting \n', 'in the trees. The biggest reward, Vihaan says, is the reaction of people who come \n', 'to see the project. “I am very grateful for people’s reactions to everything we have \n', 'done,” he says. “I see that people are genuinely worried about where the world is \n', 'heading, and they want to do something to change it.”\n', 'There certainly is a growing environmental movement in India. At first Vi-\n', 'haan didn’t believe in advocacy work; but then he started attending the Fridays \n', 'For Future protests in Delhi. This experience changed his mind. “It was an infec-\n', 'tious feeling,” he says. “I felt like we were making a change—that if two or three \n', 'hundred people could come together, the whole country could come together.”\n', 'As a young environmental activist, Vihaan was invited to meet the Hon-\n', 'orable President of India, along with the First Lady, and visiting dignitaries, the \n', 'King and Queen of Sweden, at the president’s house. While he knew that his \n', 'visit might not change any policies, he was glad that at least the president listened \n', '91\n', 'to him. They discussed climate change, recycling, waste management, and how \n', 'young children from around the world are stepping into this domain. This visit \n', 'was a testimony to Vihaan and Nav that age is not a bar. Despite the common \n', 'feeling of disconnection between politicians and ordinary citizens, Vihaan feels it \n', 'is possible to bridge this gap.\n', 'But first, waste needs to become a political issue—and for that to happen, \n', 'people need to understand what is at stake. That is why Vihaan and Nav are using \n', 'their organization’s social media channels to educate people about the impor-\n', 'tance of segregating and recycling trash.\n', '“I think it’s really important, because we are going to grow up and live in \n', 'this world,” says Nav. “Seeing the climate in this state, it’s important to fix our \n', 'mistakes—and right now waste in India is not taken seriously.”\n', 'Vihaan and Nav have big plans for the future of One Step Greener. Before \n', 'Vihaan heads off to college and leaves the organization in his younger brother’s \n', 'hands, he wants to reach 2,000 households, and expand beyond Delhi. He also \n', 'wants to plant at least another 10 urban forests.\n', '“At the end of the day, when you do something that actually creates a differ-\n', 'ence, everyone will notice you, everyone will know you, and want to do something \n', 'that is as inspiring as the things you do,” he says.

15,Jessa Garibay-Yayen,Traveling With A Purpose,93,97,"['Traveling With A Purpose\n', 'Jessa Garibay-Yayen | The Philippines\n', 'As a teenager, every third Saturday of June, at the start of the rainy season, \n', 'Jessa and her schoolmates would wake up at 4 a.m. for the Pista y Cagueban \n', '(Feast of the Forest). “It’s a massive community event, with students, government \n', 'offficials, civic groups, individuals, families from our city,” she explains. “We are \n', 'all hauled in gigantic garbage trucks—100 people per trip—and taken up to the \n', 'mountains to the watershed areas to plant trees.” It was exciting for her, that her \n', 'whole community would wake up so early on a weekend. “It felt like such a special \n', 'moment, to get my hands dirty.”\n', 'Palawan’s capitol city of Puerto Princesa is called “City in the Forest” for the \n', 'lush green surrounding it. Only 3 percent of the pristine forests in the Philippines \n', 'are left, and most of that 3 percent is in Jessa’s hometown. It’s known as the “last \n', 'ecological frontier.”\n', 'Jessa and the families in Palawan feel super-rich living in such a paradise. \n', 'People come from around the world to see Palawan’s natural wonders. With its \n', 'wonderful coral reefs, ecosystems, and biodiversity of special plants, animals, and \n', 'habitats, it’s one of 17 mega-diverse environments in the world. It’s extremely \n', 'beautiful and extremely pristine—and it is also a very challenged and threatened \n', 'ecosystem, because over the years, it’s become a hotspot for unsustainable tourism. \n', '“There’s nothing like seeing your hometown being degraded at such a fast rate to \n', 'inspire you to take really bold actions towards conserving this wonderful place we \n', 'live in,” says Jessa, adding “And where you want to raise your own children.”\n', 'At an early age, Jessa dedicated her life to caring for her island’s precious \n', 'land. At 14, she was chosen as a youth speaker for local schools, speaking about \n', 'what youth can do to help safeguard clean air for everyone. Since then, she’s had \n', 'lots of empowering experiences.\n', 'And she has lots of visual metaphors to share her story—for one of them, \n', '93\n', 'she carries a childhood photo of an avocado. “In the Philippines, we eat avocados \n', 'as something that’s sweet, like as a dessert,” she explains, adding, “We put milk \n', 'and sugar on it. In the Western world I was surprised to learn that people eat av-\n', 'ocadoes differently—on toast, or in a sandwich or a salad. Everyone has different \n', 'ideas.” Jessa’s “avocado moment” inspired her to travel, and explore new ways of \n', 'doing things.\n', 'When she was 18, she first went to Manado, Indonesia, as a foreign student \n', 'on an internship program, and stayed with a local family. “I was very curious \n', 'about the world, especially about the environmental field. I was curious about \n', 'how others discover solutions to their problems, and about how people are cre-\n', 'atively solving their environmental problems in other communities.”\n', 'Thus began Jessa’s “traveling with a purpose.”\n', 'Then, when she was 21, she traveled to the United States, to Seattle, to work \n', 'with EarthCorps, where she met other emerging youth environmental leaders \n', 'from different countries. There, building and restoring trails and salmon habitats, \n', 'she learned about native plants, invasive species—and herself.\n', 'In 2016, when she was 26, Jessa was invited to be part of the International \n', 'Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in Honolulu, to speak alongside then-\n', 'US Department of Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. There she encouraged other \n', 'youth to pursue environmental- related careers. “It was such a big audience!” she \n', 'says. “I met a lot of like-minded individuals my age. It keeps you inspired and \n', 'motivated in the work you’re doing. It really was such an amazing experience to \n', 'get my voice to be on that kind of platform.”\n', 'Invigorated by her travels, Jessa returned home to create the Centre for \n', 'Sustainability PH in the Philippines (CSPH), a women-led youth environmental \n', 'conservation NGO. It’s a team of six young folks. “We all have had the same \n', 'childhood, we grew up swimming in the sea with turtles and exploring the wild \n', 'forests as our backyard,” she says.\n', 'CSPH has found its niche as a conservation lobbying organization. The \n', 'tourist boom in Palawan has led foreigners to buy land and build lodging and \n', 'restaurants. Without zoning laws and permits to help govern them, a lot of the \n', 'land is near critical areas. Much of the land is undocumented, so having legal \n', 'documents to claim people’s land rights is essential. “Unless we lobby for some \n', 'control over local peoples’ lands, the situation is going to continue to degrade at \n', 'a fast pace...this is the only way to really ensure that we will be able to enjoy the \n', 'land in perpetuity.” \n', '“At CSPH, we believe the best way to ensure the sustainability of our island \n', ' 94\n', 'is by legally protecting our natural resources—fish stocks, forests, and our water-\n', 'sheds—creating protected areas, led by Indigenous and local communities,” Jessa \n', 'says. “Our work comes from communities, for communities, to communities, for \n', 'many years to come.”\n', '“As a young person, it’s really easy to be disregarded by a lot of the old \n', 'politicians and leaders who think youth are inadequate, just not capable of doing \n', 'something.” To strengthen their position, Jessa says, “We put everything on paper. \n', 'When we write to politicians, we make sure everything is in black and white, ev-\n', 'erything is well reported and well published. We have good records, so people can \n', 'see that we’re actually doing the work.”\n', 'Jessa works with local people to help them understand how their lands are \n', 'being ravaged by illegal logging, mining, monocropping, poaching, and wildlife \n', 'trade “Conservation work is stronger when it’s backed up by strong science,” she \n', 'adds. “Thanks to our research, two amphibians that were lost track of for about \n', 'four or five decades were rediscovered.” Strong scientific rediscoveries like this \n', 'have enabled Jessa to lobby more effectively to various stakeholders and govern-\n', 'ment agencies.\n', 'Now at age 29, the heart of Jessa’s work is focusing on conserving the forests, \n', 'building on her success with the Cleopatra’s Needle Critical Habitat Project. “Five \n', 'years ago when I started this project, I said to myself that protecting Cleopatra’s \n', 'Needle conserve, 41,350 hectares of land, is enough of a legacy for me to my \n', 'hometown.” She knew this is her island’s best protection against climate change. \n', '“To be honest, it’s really addicting,” Jessa admits. “You just want to go out and \n', 'declare more areas for conservation.” Their new goal is 300,000 hectares, more \n', 'than three quarters of a million acres.\n', '“It’s very easy for people with initiatives and vision to just barge into a com-\n', 'munity and say, ‘Hey, this is what we think you should do. One thing we’ve learned \n', 'is to be really good at drinking coffee,” Jessa says, with a smile. “We spend a lot of \n', 'time sitting down with community members, especially with Indigenous people in \n', 'their communities, and just drinking coffee with them. We hang out with them at \n', 'their homes, and really try to listen to them, and build connections.”\n', 'Jessa credits CSPH’s success partly with being a small organization. “We’ve \n', 'spent a lot of time really getting to know the people, showing them how sincere \n', 'we are in the work we’re doing. We’ve invested so much in doing community \n', 'organizing work, really being out there. Our flagship project, saving the Almaciga \n', 'tree, was conceived because of the time we had spent in the communities. It’s \n', 'very important to the Indigenous communities. And it’s the first ever seed-based \n', '95\n', 'propagation of the Almaciga tree species.”\n', 'As a nation of 7,000 islands, the Philippines is one of the most vulnerable \n', 'to climate change. “We’re seeing a lot of devastation happening in our commu-\n', 'nities due to climate change,” Jessa says. Entire islands have been wiped out by \n', 'typhoons, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Until now, Palawan has remained safe, but \n', 'the rain patterns are unpredictable, and this affects farmers and food supplies. \n', 'Jessa works with the vanishing Batak tribe. With just 200 people left, they live near \n', 'river systems. As the rains become stronger year by year, the rivers flow higher, \n', 'houses are devastated, forests are destroyed. Since the Batak are hunter- gatherers \n', 'who still live by those traditions, if the forests are destroyed, there’s no food for \n', 'them. “The Batak people I work with, they’re actually hungry; they don’t have \n', 'enough food to gather.”\n', 'One of Jessa’s biggest lessons learned is to be reflective. “When you do a lot \n', 'of work in the environment, it’s not easy,” she admits. “A lot of people don’t like to \n', 'hear about what went wrong,” she explains. “There’s actually very little published \n', 'about the failures in conservation work. And while it’s great to see success stories, \n', 'it’s also important to reflect on what the failures are. To reflect on the past so \n', 'we can actually take that on into something more, something bigger, something \n', 'smarter. So we strive to account for all the things that went wrong for us.”\n', 'In 2019 Jessa was invited to Geneva, Switzerland by the Conservation of \n', 'International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). As part of the technical ad-\n', 'visory group for the Philippine delegation, voting on the Endemic Species Trade, \n', 'Jessa lobbied for the Asian small-clawed otters, who are found only in Palawan. \n', '“We won, and got it listed in the CITES Appendix I,” she says. “It was a big \n', 'success for me as a young person, in such a very big and really old audience. It \n', 'was such an empowering experience, to be able to influence other countries to \n', 'do something about conserving animals that are present in your own hometown.”\n', 'Each year Jessa joins in the Feast of the Forests, to reconnect with her com-\n', 'munity, and with nature, to get her hands dirty, and plant trees. “I look up to a lot \n', 'of the women leaders in my community; they are my heroines,” she says.\n', 'Jessa is also aligned with Greta Thunberg’s 30 by 30 Campaign, to take \n', 'immediate actions by 2030. “That’s the path we’re on; we want to conserve as \n', 'much forest as possible in the next 10 years. We’re lobbying our partners, our \n', 'stakeholders, our donors, telling them that we have to conserve 30 percent of the \n', 'Earth’s surface to ensure good sources of clean water, fresh air for our habitats, \n', 'and for biodiversity.

16,Kevin J. Patel,We Are The Leaders Of Today,97,101,"['We Are The Leaders Of Today\n', 'Kevin J. Patel | Los Angeles, California\n', 'Kevin J. Patel was sitting in class one day, listening to his teacher, when \n', 'suddenly he realized that something was wrong. At first his teacher didn’t believe \n', 'him—and he remembered that that morning he had drunk a lot of coffee, so \n', 'maybe that was why he felt so strange. But it felt more serious than that; his heart \n', 'was racing, and he could barely breathe. Finally, he went to see the school nurse, \n', 'who immediately called an ambulance, and Kevin’s parents. When he got to the \n', 'hospital, his heart was beating at 200-300 beats per minute.\n', '97\n', '“I will remember that day for the rest of my life,” Kevin says. “That one \n', 'moment changed my life forever.”\n', 'Kevin started researching. He was wondering why a healthy boy like himself, \n', 'who was physically active, had regular check-ups, and had never had any prior \n', 'health problems, would suddenly get such serious heart palpitations.\n', 'His health scare had serious consequences. For two years, he was in and out \n', 'of the hospital. When they saw him, his schoolmates would ask him in a surprised \n', 'tone if he had changed schools. “I knew that I was being affected by air pollution \n', 'and smog, because my neighborhood is so heavily polluted,” Kevin says. “What \n', 'else would cause a heart issue like this?” And he adds, “A lot of other members of \n', 'my community were getting heart issues as well.”\n', 'Kevin lives in South Los Angeles, a community that he himself describes as \n', 'marginalized. There are many issues in his neighborhood he says—homelessness, \n', 'no access to healthy foods, and of course, air pollution. Already in middle school \n', 'he had been advocating on the issue of food inequality. “Our community is essen-\n', 'tially a food prison,” he says. “We don’t have access to good food, organic foods, \n', 'like more affluent communities have.”\n', 'As an Indian-Asian-American in a mostly African-American and Latin-X \n', 'community, Kevin had always felt marginalized, within a marginalized popula-\n', 'tion. In school, there were clubs and resources for other members of his commu-\n', 'nity, but he was often the odd one out. So in ninth grade, when he returned to \n', 'school after the incident with his heart, Kevin decided to start his own club, to \n', 'deal with the issue that had affected him on such a personal level: he started an \n', 'Environmental Club.\n', 'To his surprise, and delight, the club was a huge success. For the first meeting, \n', 'more than 100 students showed up; they couldn’t all fit into one classroom. Over \n', 'the next four years, Kevin’s Environmental Club tackled issues like reducing food \n', 'waste, often combining their environmental work with other societal problems, to \n', 'create synergies. For example, they installed bins at the school to collect dry food \n', 'items from students who would have otherwise thrown them into the trash, and \n', 'donated the collected items to organizations working with the homeless.\n', 'They also got everyone to help with recycling: whenever someone on cam-\n', 'pus would find a bottle, they could throw them into the recycling bins put up by \n', 'the Environmental Club. The club then used the money generated from recycling \n', 'the bottles to donate to food banks.\n', '“It was astonishing to see how much of a success we were,” Kevin remembers. \n', '“It was a real change within our school. They’re still continuing this project today.”\n', ' 98\n', 'Both as a student who had been interested in food issues from an early age, \n', 'and then as an environmental justice activist after his heart problems began, Kev-\n', 'in feels he didn’t have much of a choice.\n', '“My activism is literally a survival tool,” he says. “It’s something I have to do, \n', 'in order to make sure that my community has a voice.”\n', 'Kevin had known about the facts of climate change for a long time: as a \n', 'child he wanted to become a botanist, so he knew about the effect of global warm-\n', 'ing on plants. But because he is from a low-income neighborhood, he argues that \n', 'his community is particularly affected by climate change.\n', '“We are given little to no resources to combat these issues,” he says. “We \n', 'also have deadly fossil fuel infrastructure in our communities. Many affluent \n', 'communities are not as affected by the climate crisis as much as marginalized \n', 'communities like mine are.”\n', 'Over the years, Kevin became a well-known activist. He has introduced mo-\n', 'tions in Los Angeles County, and for some time he also worked with a number of \n', 'nonprofit organizations, like Zero Hour, Ignition Green, and the Student Climate \n', 'Emergency Coalition. He has also given a lot of talks at protests and other climate \n', 'action events. For some time he joined the Fridays For Future movement, and was \n', 'trying to convince as many people as possible that it’s high time to act.\n', '“We really need to start taking action; this is not a time to wait around for \n', 'change to happen through our government officials,” he says. “It’s really up to us \n', 'to take up the mantle, and start taking action.”\n', 'Kevin is also one of the UN ambassadors for the Together Band Initiative, \n', 'which is fighting for implementation of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development \n', 'Goals. And it was right before the 2019 UN Climate Summit, during the world-\n', 'wide Strike for the Climate, that a vague idea that Kevin had had before began \n', 'to take concrete shape. He started One Up Action, an organization that provides \n', 'climate activists from marginalized communities with support and resources, to \n', 'help them uplift their ideas to address the climate crisis and make them a reality.\n', '“I started working on One Up Action because I saw that young changemak-\n', 'ers and activists don’t have the resources they need to make their ideas become a \n', 'reality,” Kevin explains. “I really wanted to create an organization that can give \n', 'funds to young changemakers, or help them by providing them with connections \n', 'and opportunities, or just help them with individual actions.”\n', 'His organization started working in four different areas: they successfully \n', 'set up a Youth Climate Commission in L.A. County; they started a Community \n', '99\n', 'Science Program, which supports local changemakers; they have started chapters \n', 'of their organization in 32 countries around the world; and they introduced their \n', 'action chapter program, to support activists on the ground in their initiatives.\n', '“Young people are very, very smart,” Kevin says. “We are not only the lead-\n', 'ers of tomorrow. We are the leaders of today.”\n', 'And, for him, that is what the first-ever Youth Climate Commission in the \n', 'world is all about. It will connect 25 young changemakers in Los Angeles who act \n', 'in the capacity of commissioners, and give their feedback and input on climate \n', 'initiatives to the L.A County administration.\n', '“Their feedback is key,” Kevin says. “Whatever feedback the local govern-\n', 'ment receives, they have to take it into account; they have to make the changes in \n', 'order for their communities to be impacted in the right way.”\n', 'For Kevin, this model is an efficient way for young people to have a voice \n', 'in climate governance. One Up Action wants to introduce even more such com-\n', 'missions in the United States, and in cities across the world. That’s why they are \n', 'working closely with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group—an association \n', 'of 97 cities around the world that are dedicated to taking decisive climate action.\n', 'In Los Angeles, One Up Action has already been successful with their model \n', 'of youth participation. “When it was time for all the supervisors to vote on this, \n', 'they all voted yes. No one voted no on it,” Kevin remembers. “Then they an-\n', 'nounced that the Youth Climate Commission had passed unanimously, and the \n', 'room just erupted. There was so much excitement!”\n', 'Kevin feels that his prior work as an activist was an important factor in his \n', 'efforts to get the Youth Climate Commission started in L.A. The connections he \n', 'had built, and having an already elevated status that gave his voice weight helped \n', 'him organize the community and exert pressure. But it was never easy—and one \n', 'of the most important lessons he learned, he says, is that you can never give up in \n', 'the face of an obstacle. “It’s an uphill battle,” he says. “But in the face of adversity, \n', 'people need to step up. You should never be deterred from doing the work you \n', 'love, or the work that you want to do.”\n', 'There’s never been a ticking time bomb hanging over our heads.

17,Linus Dolder,We Will Rock This!,101,105,"['We Will Rock This!\n', 'Linus Dolder | Switzerland\n', 'Linus Dolder has been an environmentalist from an early age. It all began \n', 'with a letter that arrived at his house one day: it wasn’t meant for him. It was \n', 'actually addressed to his mother, but Linus saw it first. This was before he knew \n', 'how to read, but his interest was piqued by the picture on the envelope: it was of \n', 'a dead turtle, tangled up in a fishnet.\n', 'Linus asked his big brother to open the letter and read it out loud to him. \n', 'What he heard shocked him: it was a report about how big industries were emit-\n', 'ting chemicals and toxic waste, and using the planet as a garbage dump. “I just \n', 'really wanted to do something about it,” Linus says. “I wanted to know why these \n', 'companies were doing something so destructive; something that would cause so \n', 'much damage.”\n', 'Now 17, that feeling of outrage, he says, has remained with him to this day.\n', 'Linus sprang into action. He got together with a couple of friends and start-\n', 'ed baking. Their idea was simple: they would bake delicious cookies, sell them, \n', 'and donate their earnings to environmental organizations, for projects that were \n', 'fighting against climate change. His parents supported him, not only by allowing \n', 'him to take over the kitchen for his baking projects, but also by challenging him \n', 'in his convictions.\n', '101\n', '“They’re supportive, they often say, it’s great what you’re doing,” he says. \n', '“But they also question me, and help me to reflect on what I’m doing.” The ani-\n', 'mated debates over many family meals helped Linus strengthen his ability to justi-\n', 'fy the positions he takes. They would talk about activism and civil disobedience, or \n', 'discuss the roots of the climate crisis in our economic system. Once, Linus wanted \n', 'to discuss Obama’s foreign policy at 7 a.m., before his mother had had her coffee. \n', '“She was a bit overwhelmed, although she is normally an early riser,” he says. “I \n', 'think these discussions were kind of a nice training for activism.”\n', 'One day Linus started to realize how the environment right in his own back \n', 'yard was rapidly changing. Since he was a small child, he’d loved looking out his \n', 'bedroom window at the snowy peaks of the Bernese mountains, rising majestical-\n', 'ly above the clear blue water of Lake Thun, a layer of snow and ice covering the \n', 'mountaintops. But he began to notice a change in the picturesque landscape. He \n', 'could see that the snow and ice, which had appeared so ageless and so immovable \n', 'to him all of his life, was slowly starting to disappear.\n', 'Linus knows these mountains well: he is a good skier, and he often hikes \n', 'in the mountains with his family. He cherishes a memory from one family trek \n', 'to the Aletsch glacier, the largest glacier in the Alps, near his home. His parents \n', 'had taken a picture of him and his brother there, with the mighty glacier in the \n', 'background, when they were young children. Ten years later, they took another \n', 'picture of them, standing in the same place. This photo would prove to Linus that \n', 'the climate crisis had arrived at his doorstep. Something had changed.\n', '“There was no glacier in the background anymore,” he says, sadly. “It was \n', 'just gone.”\n', 'Once he realized that the snowcaps on the summits of the Bernese moun-\n', 'tains really were slowly disappearing, baking alone no longer seemed a sufficient \n', 'response. So, in December 2018, right before the Christmas break, Linus once \n', 'more got together with a couple of his friends: and this time they decided they \n', 'would call for a climate strike in Thun.\n', 'It was a Wednesday night when Linus asked around in his school who would \n', 'join in a climate strike the next day. Sixty people said they would join. But that \n', 'wasn’t enough for Linus and his friends; they wanted to have an even bigger event. \n', 'So they printed flyers, sent a press release to the local newspaper, asked everyone \n', 'to tell their friends and family, and to help them spread the word in their sports \n', 'clubs and music groups.\n', 'For the next event, 800 people turned up.\n', '“We all felt so empowered, because we just put tons of effort in,” Linus says. \n', ' 102\n', '“We got young people to take to the streets all over Switzerland. We got them to \n', 'raise their voices. It felt so great!”\n', 'Although Linus got the climate strikes started in his hometown, he feels that \n', 'much more needs to be done. As a youth movement, he and others have man-\n', 'aged to spread the word and get their message out: Climate Action Now! “That \n', 'should have been the point where the government takes action,” he says. “But I \n', 'feel like we are the ones who have to do it, because we are the ones that will be left \n', 'with the pieces if nothing happens.”\n', 'With its 40,000 inhabitants, the small city of Thun isn’t exactly the most \n', 'likely epicenter of climate activism in the country. “Switzerland has the second \n', 'largest GDP per capita in the world,” Linus says. “To me, that means it has a \n', 'special responsibility in the fight against climate change. It’s just so frustrating that \n', 'they seem to not care.” He adds, “We now know that this can be different: the cli-\n', 'mate strikes have moved online because of COVID-19. This has led governments \n', 'around the world to take unprecedented action.”\n', 'For Linus, this goes to show that if governments want to act, they can. He \n', 'points out that industrialized countries, including Switzerland, have contributed \n', 'the most to the situation we’re in. So they are the ones who should be leading \n', 'the effort to fight climate change. But at the moment, they are failing to fulfill \n', 'even their meager commitments to help less developed countries with the loss \n', 'and damages caused by the climate crisis. In 2015, at COP 21 in Paris, a hundred \n', 'billion dollars were pledged to support the countries that are most vulnerable to \n', 'climate change. But the money has never arrived.\n', '“One hundred billion dollars is actually the budget that’s spent on nuclear \n', 'weapons every year,” said Linus. “That’s just kind of killing me, how they set \n', 'priorities.”\n', 'Luckily, Linus is not alone in his outrage. In an article for the German news-\n', 'paper taz, Linus described his experience participating in the events surround-\n', 'ing the COP 25 negotiations in Madrid in 2019. There, climate strikers from \n', 'all continents came together to share their experiences and perspectives on the \n', 'climate crisis.

The assignment was to write about someone who inspired her. \n', 'For Slater, the choice was clear. She had reached out to Jean-Michel Cousteau \n', 'because she admired his work as an environmentalist, and his friendly and open \n', 'way of talking to people.\n', 'Not only did the famous oceanographic explorer answer her questions: he \n', 'invited Slater to come visit the camp. “That was the first time I felt like someone \n', 'who was very important took me seriously, and wanted to listen to what I had to \n', 'say,” she says. “He was a big influence for me.”\n', 'When she met him in person, she recorded a video interview with him. At \n', 'the time she was working as a youth journalist with the My Hero project, a website \n', 'that shared inspiring stories on the internet. With a father who was a writer, and a \n', 'mother who was a film producer, Slater had always been in love with telling stories. \n', 'She made her first film when she was only six years old. “It was a musical, and I \n', 'wrote all the lyrics and the music. And I made my parents act and sing it,” she says. \n', 'The same week she also shot another film, which she starred in herself, along with \n', 'her dog. It was entitled The Girl and the Talking Dog.\n', 'Slater also loved watching movies. When she was 14 years old, she sat in her \n', 'parents’ living room and watched An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary made by \n', 'Davis Guggenheim, about global warming. It was eye-opening for her. “I remem-\n', 'ber about halfway into the film, I started crying and I didn’t really stop for about \n', '105\n', 'four or five hours,” she says. “It scared the hell out of me. It wasn’t something that \n', 'I understood or knew how to fix, and the people who could fix it were not doing \n', 'anything.”\n', 'Slater felt betrayed. All of her life she had been told that she had opportuni-\n', 'ties in her life, things that she could do and dreams she could realize if she wanted \n', 'to. Suddenly, she started to question this. “None of it felt like it was real anymore, \n', 'because there was this big thing called climate change rising up in the middle of \n', 'my life, that made everything uncertain and unstable,” she says. “And I wanted \n', 'to do something. I wanted to be the person who had tried to do everything they \n', 'could.”\n', 'Slater was born in Los Angeles. Her house had a tiny backyard and it wasn’t \n', 'really safe for her to walk around the neighborhood. She constantly heard the \n', 'blaring of sirens, and her school would have lockdowns semi-regularly, every time \n', 'someone tried to rob the bank down the street. But when she was nine, she and \n', 'her parents moved to a farm outside of Toronto.\n', '“I think it really shaped the kind of person that I am, being able to spend \n', 'days and days out in the woods, learning different bird calls,” she says. “And just \n', 'feeling like I was one small organism in this greater ecosystem.”\n', 'Spending so much of her life in nature taught Slater an appreciation and \n', 'awareness for the changing seasons, and the constant circle of life and death \n', 'all around her. She also learned more about climate change, and the more she \n', 'learned, the more she began to question political leaders and authority figures. \n', 'If the people who were in a position to do something about climate change had \n', 'decided not to do anything, then who would? If they aren’t willing to act, they should \n', 'step aside, she thought.\n', 'In May 2008, when she was 15, Slater went to the Youth Environmental G8 \n', 'Summit in Japan. For the first time, she got to meet young people from all over \n', 'the world whose lives were being impacted by climate change. And they had all \n', 'had enough.\n', 'Slater brought her camera to the summit. There she made lifelong friends, \n', 'and it was also there that she started what would become a 12-year documentary \n', 'film project. She decided she would tell the story of the environmental youth \n', 'movement from within. The result was a documentary entitled Youth Unstoppable.\n', '“It was literally just me with a backpack and a camera, but I was lucky to \n', 'have the support of two producers, my mom and Daniel Bekerman, who trusted \n', 'me enough to let me follow my intuition. My mom went with me to most of the \n', 'countries, and organized on the ground to get the footage we needed.”\n', ' 106\n', 'After the summit in Japan, Slater went on to travel to a number of other \n', 'climate conferences, (COPs), in Copenhagen, Cancun, Paris, Poland, and Madrid, \n', 'and she always brought her camera.\n', 'In Mexico, she would get up at 6:00 in the morning, take a bus to the confer-\n', 'ence venue, and go through strict security controls. Then she would talk to young \n', 'environmentalists and try to find good people to interview.\n', '“You go in, and there are just hundreds and hundreds of people surrounding \n', 'you, everyone going seemingly in opposite directions,” she says. “I was by myself, \n', 'working 14 hours a day and then going back at the end of the day, downloading \n', 'all of the SD cards onto my hard drive.” Then she would sleep for five hours and \n', 'do the same thing again the next day.\n', 'At the conferences, she would simply walk up to people and ask them ques-\n', 'tions. “At the beginning, I would have to say that a lot of it was adrenaline fueled \n', 'by terror,” she says, laughing. But soon she realized that she was actually in a \n', 'position of power: she had the ability to share these people’s stories, and they \n', 'needed their stories to be heard.\n', 'But it was also exhausting. “It was too overwhelming,” she says. “Climate \n', 'activism forces you to deal with worst-case scenarios, to ask difficult questions. It \n', 'makes you question a lot of the things that make up your life.” She pauses, then \n', 'adds, “And you do that alongside the frustration of seeing that year after year \n', 'people are not taking it seriously, people are not doing what they need to do, \n', 'governments aren’t taking it seriously.”\n', 'One thing that kept Slater going is the friendships she made along the way \n', 'with other young climate activists. “It was a lot of fun,” she says. “You’re going up \n', 'against something, and you feel like what you’re doing is right. You feel this sense \n', 'of camaraderie, being part of this community that has a purpose.”\n', 'Besides, giving up the fight against climate change had never been an option \n', 'for Slater. “I think we all share this feeling that this is the most important thing \n', 'we’ve ever come across,” she says. “It’s a mixture of perseverance and stubborn-\n', 'ness, but it’s also the feeling that I am doing something that might actually matter. \n', 'That it might affect other people, and create positive change.”\n', 'In December 2015, after filming for eight years, Slater thought that she \n', 'had found an ending for her movie. She was in Paris; and after having been dis-\n', 'appointed so many times before, it seemed like finally there would be a global \n', 'agreement to act on climate change.\n', '“I was a bit wary of the excitement that was building about the Paris Climate \n', '107\n', 'Agreement, because I had seen that same thing happen before,” Slater says. “But it \n', 'also felt like it really was an opportunity, that this could potentially finally happen.”\n', 'After a particularly long day of filming, Slater was on the way to a youth art \n', 'space outside of the French capital, when suddenly her phone began to ring. The \n', 'Paris Agreement had passed! Emails and texts started coming in like mad; some \n', 'of her friends were celebrating the Accord; others were disappointed that the deal \n', 'wouldn’t be legally binding.\n', '“I was very confused about how to feel,” Slater says. “Because it felt like a \n', 'victory; at the same time, it felt like it wasn’t enough.”\n', 'But, overall, Slater decided to look on the bright side: the way she saw it, this \n', 'deal was an opportunity to finally stop bickering and get to work on the problem. \n', 'That’s why she thought she finally had the ending for her film.\n', 'But it still didn’t feel quite right, and she still had lingering doubts. “It was \n', 'like, oh, is that it?” Slater says. “Is this the end of the film? Did we really win?”\n', 'Then in 2016, when Donald Trump was elected President of the United \n', 'States, it felt like a backlash to the successful environmental movement that had \n', 'made the Paris Agreement possible. So Slater kept on filming: and within a cou-\n', 'ple of years, the environmental movement had come back in full force, led by a \n', 'young Swedish activist who caught the world’s imagination, and who helped bring \n', 'together the energy of other dynamic and devoted youth leaders from around the \n', 'world.\n', '“To see Greta, Luisa, Jamie, and Xiuhtezcatl, and all the climate strikes, it’s \n', 'incredibly beautiful and inspiring and exciting, after trying for so long to have \n', 'young people’s voices be heard,” she says. “The school strike movement has be-\n', 'come such a worldwide phenomenon! Seeing millions and millions of people out \n', 'in the streets, it’s incredible. It’s amazing!”\n', 'In the end Slater worked on Youth Unstoppable for 12 years. She shot over 500 \n', 'hours of footage, and spent 19 months editing. It was finally released in 2018, and \n', 'has played in over 100 film festivals worldwide, and has garnered 13 awards to \n', 'date.\n', 'This film paints a clear picture of the roots of the youth climate action \n', 'movement. “I’ve had young people come up to me and say that, for the first time, \n', 'they felt like they were actually spoken to as human beings and not just spoken \n', 'down to,” she says. “And I’ve had older people come up to me and say that they \n', 'had lost all hope. And that they feel re- inspired; that our generation actually cares \n', 'and is doing something.”\n', ' 108\n', 'Slater still has the little sea urchin that Jean-Michel Cousteau gave to her \n', 'all those years ago, after listening closely to what she had to say. “We’re all in \n', 'this together,” she says. “I think we need to truly listen to each other, and allow \n', 'ourselves to be inspired; and to re-inspire each other with our stories.

In this community of \n', 'around 100 people there was no electricity or running water, but you could walk \n', 'for nearly 100 miles in any direction and be surrounded by nature. The Gwich’in \n', 'nation villages, some located in Alaska, and some in Canada, are along the migra-\n', 'tory route of the porcupine caribou herd, a primary food source for the Gwich’in \n', 'people. Whitefish, grayling, pike, and salmon migrate through the river systems, \n', 'and ducks and geese migrate in the spring and fall. As a child, Evon’s job was to \n', 'haul water from the river, where they kept a hole in the ice throughout the winter. \n', 'He carried five-gallon buckets of water on a wooden yoke over his shoulders. His \n', 'family kept a fire going day and night.\n', 'Despite what seems like a storied childhood steeped in natural beauty, Evon \n', 'faced challenges early in his life. The public education offered in his village was \n', 'sub-par, with just one teacher for grades 6-12. Evon’s mother moved them to \n', 'Fairbanks for junior high school so he could receive a better education. It was \n', 'during this time that Evon remembers being brought into a room with 14 other \n', 'Alaska Native boys, where a counselor told them that they were more likely to end \n', 'up dead or in jail by the time they were 25 than they were to graduate high school. \n', 'Sadly, his words proved true. Of the 14 boys, one committed suicide and only one \n', 'or two finished high school.\n', 'When he was 16 years old, Evon had an epiphany about the profound ineq-\n', 'uities between the Native and non-Native peoples in Alaska. “We are not taught in \n', 'our schools about the history of colonization and the assimilation of Indigenous \n', 'peoples; and the trauma and social challenges that persist in many Indigenous \n', 'communities as a reflection of those experiences,” he says. “And there is a contin-\n', ' 120\n', 'ued colonization of Indigenous peoples that persists to this day as well.”\n', 'He had learned about the boarding schools his mother had been sent to, \n', 'where they were not allowed to speak their language, and told that their spiritual \n', 'practices and traditions were wrong, and that they must be forgotten if they want-\n', 'ed to fit into society. This deeply affected his mother, who demonstrated symptoms \n', 'of a “heart wound,” Evon says. When Evon was growing up, his mother would \n', 'sometimes lock herself in her room and cry.\n', 'Evon had dropped out of high school, but later he argued for admission into \n', 'the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), where he received his BA in Alaska \n', 'Native Studies, with a minor in Political Science. As a college student, he became \n', 'active in student government, where he organized and co-led a Native student \n', 'organization. These experiences launched him on his lifelong quest to learn about \n', 'the history and laws that have contributed to the suffering of Alaskan Indigenous \n', 'communities. “I learned that my grandparents weren’t citizens of the United \n', 'States when they were young,” says Evon. “They didn’t have the right to own \n', 'land or own a business. They were explicitly discriminated against in our own \n', 'homelands.” So it was with great pride, and deeply personal, that Evon testified in \n', 'February 2020 in a state legislative hearing on behalf of his people, for the passing \n', 'of HB 221, a bill which formally recognizes the tribal sovereignty of 229 Alaska \n', 'Native tribes.\n', 'In his early 20’s Evon became the youngest chief in the Alaskan interior. He \n', 'attributes this honor to being raised with strong roots in his Gwich’in identity, and \n', 'a drive to acquire Western education as well. “I spent the next three years strug-\n', 'gling to lead my people and learning the realities of being an Indigenous leader, \n', 'subject to the powers of the state and federal governments,” he says.\n', 'Because to a great extent Alaskan people live off the land, Evon is greatly \n', 'concerned about how his people will survive. “When I was younger, it was not un-\n', 'common to face 65 degree below zero weather for a week at a time,” he says. Over \n', 'the years, there has been a shift upward of approximately 13 degrees in winter, \n', 'and the change has had an undeniable impact on the people living in the Arctic. \n', 'Lakes are either drying up or are flooded, depending upon where they are, and on \n', 'how the thawing permafrost is affecting local geography. This leads to increased \n', 'erosion, especially in coastal areas, and also in the river systems.\n', '“We’re seeing a shift in the types of animals and species that are showing up, \n', 'or no longer showing up, in our lands,” Evon says. “We had a major die-off in the \n', 'Koyukuk River just this last summer. They’re speculating that the thousands of \n', 'salmon that died in that river died because the water was too warm. They over-\n', '121\n', 'heated and couldn’t make it up to their spawning grounds.” Evon also believes \n', 'that agricultural pollutants used in other parts of the world are migrating into the \n', 'Arctic. “It’s impacting the health and well-being of our people,” he says.\n', 'In 2014 Evon was appointed Vice Chancellor for Rural, Community, and \n', 'Native Education at UAF, which is the largest producer of Arctic research world-\n', 'wide. The chancellor of UAF is committed to strengthening global leadership \n', 'in Indigenous programs, including the preservation and documenting of Native \n', 'languages that are at risk of disappearing. “I never in my wildest dreams imag-\n', 'ined I would ever be a vice chancellor at a university,” says Evon, who quickly \n', 'realized the position gave him the opportunity to reshape education in Alaska, by \n', 'modifying both the curriculum and the teaching methods. He was responsible \n', 'for managing six community campuses across the state, serving students with 14 \n', 'different Indigenous languages, coming from 140 tribal governments, and 160 \n', 'communities. “I’ve been able to engage with so many young people,” he says, a \n', 'note of gratitude in his voice.\n', 'Central to the career path that led him to his role as vice chancellor was \n', 'Evon’s work as executive director of Native Movement, a nonprofit organization \n', 'he and his wife, Enei Begaye, cofounded in 2004. “Native Movement is a collec-\n', 'tive of around 15 organizers. We work on a range of projects that focus on youth \n', 'leadership development, sustainability, protection of sacred sites, and social, po-\n', 'litical, economic, and environmental justice,” he says. They have hosted a variety \n', 'of events, including vigils, marches, youth summits, concerts, and workshops. The \n', 'organization was created while Evon was chief of his village and was encounter-\n', 'ing limitations even within his own tribal governance system. Today they have \n', 'offices in Fairbanks and Anchorage; and they have expanded into the area of \n', 'missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n', 'Evon focuses on issues related to healing and trauma, and the integration \n', 'of Indigenous cultural practices with behavioral health interventions. “Our major \n', 'goal is to prevent suicide, which is at epidemic levels in some of our communities,” \n', 'he says. (It is a leading cause of death for Alaska Natives between the ages of 15 \n', 'and 24.) We Breathe Again, a documentary film that explores the impact of suicide \n', 'on the lives of four Alaskans, premiered in 2017 on the PBS World Channel’s \n', 'America ReFramed; and being one of the film’s producers offered Evon the op-\n', 'portunity to cast a wider net.\n', 'Native comedian and traditional Yup’ik teacher Keggulluk Earl Polk is fea-\n', 'tured in the film. “Sing. Go back to your roots. Dig deep,” he urges. “Hit your \n', 'knees, become humble. Realize that you’re stronger than what is trying to take \n', ' 122\n', 'you away. And the only reason you’re strong is because you’re humble enough \n', 'to ask for help.” Evon hopes that the film will continue to be a useful tool to help \n', 'build bridges of communication and healing for healthcare workers and patients \n', 'alike.\n', 'Evon will be stepping down from his role as vice chancellor in June 2021 to \n', 'deepen his work at the community level, as well as in international global advocacy. \n', 'He plans to continue his work with suicide prevention and immerse himself in his \n', 'passion for the preservation of Indigenous languages. “We have 20 Alaska Native \n', 'languages, and one of them has already lost its last speaker,” he says. “I want to \n', 'be part of helping to revitalize my language, the Gwich’in language. We’re down \n', 'to less than 800 speakers worldwide. Now is the moment for us to work with our \n', 'elders to document the language as best we can, and create a curriculum, and \n', 'lesson plans.” His dream is to create a Gwich’in language immersion school, or \n', '“nest,” where, starting at three years old, children would speak only in Gwich’in.\n', '“I know some people in higher education expect me to go on to be a chan-\n', 'cellor, or president of a university.

It’s a \n', 'place that for centuries has shown that humans and the natural world can coexist, \n', 'in harmony with one another.\n', 'It’s here that Lucia Ixchíu grew up. She’s Indigenous—as are her parents, \n', 'and their parents before them—and she is proud of her heritage. But she didn’t \n', 'always feel like she fit into the common stereotypes about Indigenous people, es-\n', 'pecially Indigenous women. In fact, growing up Lucia was a bit of a rebel.\n', 'Her first act of rebellion came when she was just four years old. When it \n', 'came to after-school activities, the gender roles in her small community school \n', 'were quite strict. Boys took karate classes, while the girls would learn to play in-\n', 'struments, dance, and cook. No one questioned this until Lucia came along and \n', 'decided to flip the gender roles upside down. When she was told that she couldn’t \n', 'attend karate lessons, she went up to her music teacher after class and told him, \n', 'simply and directly, that she wanted to do karate as well. He respected her choice. \n', 'Looking back, she sees that this was the moment she became an activist. “From \n', 'that age, from that moment, I discovered that my opinion mattered, that my opin-\n', 'ion had value, and that it should be respected,” she says.\n', 'Not only was Lucia the only girl in her school to participate in a boys’ sport \n', 'that year, she was the first girl to ever do so. She remembers walking proudly along \n', 'with the boys, all of them decked out in karate suits and belts, in the community \n', 'parade that same year. It was her first act of rebellion, and a sign of things to \n', 'come for Lucia.\n', 'Lucia thanks her mother and father for teaching her how to think outside of \n', ' 124\n', 'the box and fight for what she believes in from an early age. They supported her \n', 'creativity, gave her an education, and instilled in her a lifelong passion for art and \n', 'sports. But she also thanks something else for her political awakening—rock music.\n', 'Rock came into her life when she was 11. She liked the traditional music of \n', 'her Indigenous community, but she loved rock ‘n roll even more. She could hear \n', 'it on the radio from time to time when the signal from larger cities flitted onto \n', 'her radio at home. She listened to the Beatles, Rage Against the Machine, and \n', 'the Spanish folk metal group Mägo de Oz. She was especially inspired by Mägo \n', 'de Oz. In 2003, these Madrid rockers released the first album of a trilogy, “Gaïa.” \n', 'The album, which is named after the Latin name for planet earth, became like a \n', 'handbook for Lucia.\n', '“In my own personal development, I always talk about music, and especially \n', 'rock music, because that was the first thing in my life that politicized me,” she \n', 'says. “These groups spoke to me about the importance of protecting mother \n', 'earth; about sexual diversity, about the importance of loving everyone equally; \n', 'and about a whole heap of things that impacted me at that age.”\n', 'For Lucia, music provided a way to break down the stereotypes about In-\n', 'digenous Mayan women. She says it helped her to “decolonize” her mind from \n', 'Western thinking and begin to understand that being an Indigenous woman itself \n', 'required an act of rebellion against a system inherently structured against her. She \n', 'gained a newfound appreciation for the land, as well—a land that her community \n', 'had owned and protected against invasion from other countries for centuries.\n', 'Music would continue to be important to Lucia as she grew older, but now it \n', 'took on political importance. She finished high school and went to college to study \n', 'architecture. During her studies she became involved with student activist groups \n', 'and Indigenous land protectors. And on October 4, 2012, she and a number of \n', 'other students joined a national protest against a rise in electricity prices, which \n', 'was adversely affecting poor, Indigenous Mayans, like the ones in her community. \n', 'They took to the streets peacefully and called on the private energy monopoly to \n', 'lower the prices, but the movement was broken up by armed police. Six people \n', 'were killed, and many others arrested.\n', 'Less than three weeks later, the people protested the violent repression they \n', 'had suffered, by spraying the presidential palace in Guatemala City with red paint. \n', 'The government cracked down again and this time five more student activists \n', 'were arrested.\n', 'Among the students arrested were friends of Lucia’s, fellow activists like \n', 'herself. It was another moment that marked her young life and inspired her to \n', '125\n', 'take action. She knew that if she wanted to see her friends freed, she would have \n', 'to create awareness of what was happening—and make it a loud statement. And \n', 'what better way than music?\n', 'She’d already organized a number of cultural events in her community, \n', 'around issues involving the marginalization and criminalization of Indigenous \n', 'communities, and she knew a number of musicians from her time at school. After \n', 'the October 4 massacre, she began to make her cultural activities more politically \n', 'focused, and to tell both her story and the stories of others through art and music. \n', 'She reached out to her musician friends, and one by one, they began to volunteer \n', 'their voices, and their instruments, to the campaign to free the student activists.\n', 'Along with two friends, Lucia started Festivales Solidarios (Solidarity Festi-\n', 'vals) as a way to counteract the repression they felt, as well as some of the broader \n', 'challenges facing Guatemala’s Indigenous communities. Through music, spoken \n', 'word, poetry, and art they managed to build up the momentum to free their friends.\n', 'But Festivales Solidarios wasn’t just a one-time event. Every time an activist \n', 'or a student or a journalist faces prison simply for speaking out, Lucia, her sister \n', 'Andrea, and the rest of the team at Festivales Solidarios bring together artists and \n', 'musicians to amplify everyone’s voices together.\n', 'And their action soon morphed into something even bigger—a movement \n', 'that uses art and music to create change and is bringing awareness to a variety \n', 'of forms of repression and inequality that persist across the country. In 2019, \n', 'the group created The Panal Project, which focuses on finding new ways to tell \n', 'human rights stories, and strategic use of various media and digital platforms \n', 'to address issues of territory, historical memory, and political imprisonment.

He studied biology at the Univer-\n', 'sity of Belgrade, and—as mentioned—liked to chase after girls from time to time. \n', 'He was, in many senses, a pretty typical youth. But as fate would have it, he would \n', 'not be able to live this life for long.\n', 'In the early 1990s, in his native Serbia, the political situation began to dete-\n', 'riorate. The country’s president, Slobodan Milošević, was ruling with an increas-\n', 'ingly iron fist. Milošević, who became known as the “Butcher of the Balkans,” \n', 'repressed student protesters, detained and jailed activists, and stole elections. He \n', 'left little room for dissent; the result was a culture of fear spread far and wide \n', 'across the country.\n', 'Seeing Milošević’s power grow, Srdja and thousands of other young people \n', 'were confronted with a harsh political reality—and a tough choice. Suddenly it \n', 'didn’t seem to Srdja that punk rock was the best use of his energy; nonviolent \n', 'organizing to overthrow the regime was more important.\n', '“Most of my generation had two options: One was to fight, and the other was \n', 'to flee. I was stubborn, so I decided to fight,” he says. Srdja set off on a path that \n', 'eventually led him to be called “the architect of the revolution” in Serbia—which \n', 'led later to nonviolent revolution around the world.\n', 'Through the innovative practices they developed, Srdja and other student \n', 'activists opened the world’s eyes to Milošević’s repression. In 1996, they marched \n', ' 128\n', 'peacefully through the streets of Belgrade every day for four months—braving \n', 'bad weather and police brutality. Two years later, Srdja founded Otpor! (which \n', 'means “resistance” in Serbian) with 10 other student leaders, following in the \n', 'footsteps of student groups who had protested Milošević’s regime in 1992, 1996, \n', 'and 1997.\n', 'Otpor! aimed to non-violently overthrow Milošević—by voting him out \n', 'of office—and even to have a little bit of fun doing so.

Years later, it \n', 'became a symbol of their resistance.

In the elections that year, nearly 90 percent of \n', 'voters under the age of 29 cast their votes—almost all of them against Milošević. \n', 'He didn’t even receive enough votes to make it to the second round of voting.

He kept working to grow Otpor! and to spread their \n', 'message of nonviolent resistance across the region and around the world. In fewer \n', 'than 10 years, Otpor! became one of the most well-known youth movements of \n', 'all time. In the mid-2000s, it had more than 20,000 members.

In Los Angeles at \n', 'the premiere of PBS’s Bringing Down the Dictator, he was honored to be among other \n', 'great leaders who had taken a stand for their people and their country. Srjda has \n', 'turned his student activism in Serbia into a lifelong commitment to helping to \n', 'support nonviolent resistance in more than 40 countries. He says this type of work \n', 'keeps him feeling young. “I am still figuring out what I want to be when I grow \n', 'up,” Srdja says with a smile. “Basically my life is helping people figure out how to \n', 'build movements for social change.”\n', 'After the fall of Milošević and the success of Otpor!, Srdja founded the Cen-\n', 'ter for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS), which has worked \n', 'with activists in 46 countries, including Venezuela, Iran, and Syria.

It starts with four steps:\n', '1.  Vision. “You can never win by being against something,” he says. In-\n', 'stead, climate activists around the world need to present a new way \n', 'forward. A Green New Deal? Maybe. “You need to find the visionary \n', 'document, or idea, and explain how the world will be different if you \n', 'win.”\n', '2.  Unity. In order for the movement to succeed, it has to stay together. \n', '“How do you unite different players?” Srdja asks.

24,Jerome Foster II,Changemaking From The Nation’s Capital,132,136,"['Changemaking From The Nation’s Capital\n', 'Jerome Foster II | Washington, DC\n', 'As an African-American child growing up near the nation’s capital, Jerome \n', 'Foster explored the forests surrounding his home in the D.C. suburbs. “I was the \n', 'type of kid who could just be outdoors all day. I loved it,” he says. “I couldn’t wait \n', 'to finish my schoolwork and chores so I could go out into the forest and explore \n', 'the creeks and plains; and watch the animals with my parents and grandfather.” \n', 'Little did he know that one day he would become one of the youth leaders pas-\n', 'sionately helping to bridge the gaps between environmentalism and social issues \n', 'in the national political landscape.\n', 'When Jerome first heard about climate change and global warming, he did \n', 'what he did with any academic subject – he read everything he could. Once he \n', 'had a strong base in the science, he dug deep into how these issues were impacting \n', 'the cultural conversation. “Watching An Inconvenient Truth, I was blown away by the \n', 'scale of the crisis,” he says. “Then when I saw how many people Avatar drew to \n', 'the theatres, I realized how people really cared about social justice. It was a huge \n', 'number! However, they weren’t being spoken up for in my circles.”\n', 'So when he was in middle school, Jerome started his first Facebook page: \n', 'he wanted his peers to understand what climate change, global warming, and \n', 'sustainability is all about. His habit of posting 4-5 times a day gained him a lot \n', 'of followers. Seeing that he could raise such awareness by himself, he decided it \n', 'was time he joined with others. “When I was in 8th grade, I jumped right in with \n', 'The People’s Climate March in D.C., as an intern,” he says. “I helped organize \n', 'climate marches, and made an immediate impact. It was so exciting; I even gave \n', 'presentations at my school.”\n', 'By the time Jerome was in high school, his bright, technical mind was fully \n', 'engaged. He was fascinated to learn about how tech could be used to revolution-\n', 'ize education and get young people more involved in social justice movements. “I \n', ' 132\n', 'always understood what BLM (Black Lives Matter), women’s rights, and other \n', 'mainstream social justice movements were about,” he says. “But I never realized \n', 'that these had anything to do with climate change. And when I did, I decided to \n', 'do something about it.”\n', 'Climate change and global warming impact women, minorities, marginal-\n', 'ized peoples, and Indigenous communities disproportionately compared to the \n', 'rest of the population. In the African American community alone, 71 percent of \n', 'the people live in areas where the air quality is unsafe, because of their proximity \n', 'to industrial manufacturing, and other factors. One day, Jerome’s teachers chal-\n', 'lenged him to use his technical abilities to highlight these issues by creating his \n', 'own little business. And they told him that the World Series of Entrepreneurship \n', '(TWSOE) was only five days away.\n', 'And so, at 14, Jerome founded TAU VR, a civics-based virtual reality com-\n', 'pany that promotes empathy and compassion. In TAU VR’s 3D virtual space, \n', 'people have a simulated experience of another person’s experience. Jerome’s \n', 'model simulated the experience of a 5-year- old migrant child from Guatemala \n', 'making the dramatic and difficult journey to Texas. “Parts of Central and South \n', 'America are becoming uninhabitable due to climate change,” Jerome says. “By \n', 'vicariously experiencing a journey like this, it can give people a more sympathetic \n', 'view of those who are suffering from our global environmental crisis. It can help \n', 'the average person understand the many obstacles that my character is dealing \n', 'with.”\n', 'While TAU VR was a success, Jerome felt that he had much, much more \n', 'to offer. Shortly thereafter, he had another jolt of inspiration. “I saw Leonardo \n', 'DiCaprio’s documentary Before the Flood. The whole film was amazing,” he says. \n', '“At the end, he had a message that there aren’t enough people covering climate \n', 'change in a way that it should be covered—especially young people. I realized \n', 'that not only was he right, but I could actually be the one to try to remedy this \n', 'problem.” And so, in 2017 he created his next entrepreneurial venture in digital \n', 'media: The Climate Reporter.\n', 'The Climate Reporter is a collection of international youth writing about climate \n', 'change, global warming, environmental justice, and other sustainability issues \n', 'around the world. The site has a wide range of journalistic products, including \n', 'op-eds, films, videos, podcasts, interviews, breaking news, stories from frontline \n', 'communities, and an impressive range of cutting-edge digital content. The envi-\n', 'ronmental news site receives roughly 600,000 views a month, and is among the \n', 'top up and coming publications in the youth sustainability space.\n', '133\n', 'The Climate Reporter’s excellent reporting got the attention of notable climate \n', 'change youth leaders, like Greta Thunberg and her team. Then in 2019, Jerome \n', 'organized the D.C. chapter of the worldwide youth School Strikes for Climate. To \n', 'lend her star power and show her support for the Global Climate Strikes, Greta \n', 'traveled for the very first time by sailboat from Europe to New York, and then \n', 'went on to Washington, DC Her presence at these strikes raised an enormous \n', 'amount of awareness, and garnered overwhelming support for the movement. \n', 'Other notable activists, celebrities, and entrepreneurs began joining in, inspired \n', 'by Jerome’s infectious spirit, among them lifelong activist Jane Fonda, who stood \n', 'beside him.\n', 'Inspired by these courageous young leaders, Ms. Fonda launched her Fire \n', 'Drill Fridays. Every Friday, from November through February, hundreds of peo-\n', 'ple, including Jerome, have joined with this famous actress and lifelong activist to \n', 'raise awareness about the climate emergency by protesting at the nation’s capital. \n', 'Other celebrities have joined her too, using their star power to get media attention \n', 'for the cause. As they increasingly engaged in very visible and strategic acts of civil \n', 'disobedience, some of them, including Ms. Fonda, were arrested.\n', 'After each climate strike, Jerome met with congressional staff at the U.S. \n', 'Capital to talk about what they could be doing for climate justice. His diligence \n', 'led to a life-changing opportunity for Jerome when he was invited to serve as an \n', 'intern and be mentored by U.S. Representative John Lewis. Jerome was aware of \n', 'how this legendary congressman had, as a 25-year-old, marched with Dr. Martin \n', 'Luther King Jr. in Selma, Alabama, and had helped to create SNCC (the Student \n', 'Nonviolent Organizing Committee), which played a key role in the Civil Rights \n', 'movement. “To be able to learn from this true civil rights icon was amazing,” \n', 'Jerome says. “It really made me rethink a lot of my prior assumptions about what \n', 'is important—especially about giving back.”\n', 'With service and social responsibility in mind, Jerome founded OneMil-\n', 'lionOfUS, a nonprofit voting advocacy organization that galvanizes the resources \n', 'needed to facilitate an active voter turnout among youth. To help make the voting \n', 'process easier and more affordable for youth, Jerome created partnerships with \n', 'companies like Lyft, which provides discounted rides for youth to help them get \n', 'to voting stations. Then, before the 2020 elections, Jerome had a lofty goal–to get \n', '1,000,000 youth voters registered in time to vote. It was an intense, exciting, and \n', 'ultimately successful endeavor. It is estimated that 52-55 percent of the country’s \n', 'youth voted in that election, and their impact was huge—especially among young \n', 'people of color, who overwhelming supported President Joe Biden. It was an \n', ' 134\n', 'especially powerful time for Jerome, who joined forces with other organizations \n', 'to successfully fight for U.S. Congressman Lewis’s former Congressional seat in \n', 'Clayton County, Georgia. And in the spring of 2021, Jerome was honored to be \n', 'invited to join President Biden’s Inaugural Environmental Justice Advisory Coun-\n', 'cil at the White House to help plan a strategy to combat the global climate crisis.\n', 'For youth who want to be involved in social justice, advocacy, and other \n', 'cause-related work, Jerome’s message is simple: “Start with empathy and under-\n', 'standing,” he says, advice that applies to many diverse pathways. He believes that \n', 'starting by educating oneself on the issues you are passionate about is the key. \n', '“Read an article about it. Then read five more. Watch documentaries. Reach out \n', 'to the people involved with the issues you are passionate about. Learn from them. \n', 'And join the organizations that serve and support these causes.”\n', 'When it comes to solving problems, Jerome never has, and never intends to \n', 'stick to one single issue – which is the exact kind of broad thinking we need more \n', 'of this day and age.

She started small by using less plastic; \n', 'then, one thing led to another. She and a few students started a food cooperative \n', 'that focused on environmentally friendly products, as well as issues of labor justice. \n', 'The more she came to understand American society’s dominant institutions, the \n', 'bigger the issues she began to focus on. “And what bigger issue does the environ-\n', 'mental community face than fossil fuels?”\n', 'Digging down into the research, Alyssa was shocked to discover that many \n', 'universities across the country were investing in and profiting off of the very fossil \n', 'fuel companies that were causing environmental catastrophes. She just couldn’t \n', 'stand to see the negative impact of an influential institution such as hers on the \n', 'next generation of young leaders. So in 2013 she started the Fossil Free UCLA \n', 'Divestment Campaign—and by 2020 it was announced that the investment port-\n', 'folio for the entire University of California system, not just UCLA, was fossil free.\n', 'Initially the divestment movement targeted universities, demanding that \n', 'they change their investment strategies away from fossil fuel companies, and re-\n', 'direct and reinvest their funds in renewable energies, and programs that build \n', 'community wealth, well-being, and regeneration; and that is where it all began. \n', ' 136\n', '“There’s a tradition going back a long ways,” Alyssa says. “I’m just carrying the \n', 'banner of so many great environmentalists before me.

She went with her college’s student \n', 'council on an integration project with the Lumad Indigenous people from the \n', 'southern Mindanao region of the Philippines. One of the leaders told her about \n', 'his people being displaced, harassed, and even killed, just for protecting their \n', 'lands and the environment from extractive mining companies.

This led her to partner \n', 'with the international youth climate movement Fridays For Future founded by \n', 'Greta Thunberg, and to form the regional Youth Advocates for Climate Action \n', 'Philippines (YACAP).\n', 'With the formation of YACAP, Mitzi has taken a prominent leadership \n', 'position fighting with MAPA in her region and beyond. “With this planetary \n', 'emergency, common sense would dictate that climate should be at the top of the \n', 'agenda, and that those who are already protecting the environment should be \n', 'listened to. Instead, we have no concrete climate plans from our leaders, and our \n', 'environmental activists and defenders are being harassed, displaced, even killed. \n', 'This is why YACAP has laid out five simple Points of Unity, which spells out what \n', 'actions we demand from our leaders.”\n', 'YACAP’s Five Points of Unity are centered around achieving climate justice; \n', 'highlighting the urgency of climate action; defending environmental defenders \n', 'who risk their lives to keep the natural habitat safe; driving youth-led collective \n', 'action; and affecting systemic change.\n', 'Mitzi and YACAP are also intent on getting their government officials to \n', 'declare a climate emergency, which should include a moratorium on building \n', 'any new coal-fired plants, as well as building projects in vulnerable habitats and \n', 'regions. With such victories, local jurisdictions would be forced to consider ways \n', 'to implement green energy sources and to address habitat destruction, both of \n', 'which would benefit the environmental defenders who are most affected by these \n', 'policies.\n', 'On September 25, 2020, YACAP made headlines when they held a Global \n', 'Day of Climate Action.

27,U.S. Representative John Lewis,Get Into Good Trouble!,144,147,"['Get Into Good Trouble! \n', 'U.S Representative John Lewis | Atlanta, Georgia\n', 'It was a Sunday morning in 1955 when 15-year-old John Lewis turned on \n', 'the radio. The voice he heard was of a man who would change his life forever. It \n', 'was the voice of a young minister, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was giving \n', 'a sermon. The words he preached that day inspired John to write a letter to Dr. \n', 'King, and ask for his support.\n', 'As a sophomore in high school in Troy, Alabama, John aspired to get a good \n', 'education, go to college, maybe even be the first Black youth to attend Troy State \n', 'College. He knew that college was the best way for him to build a better life \n', 'for himself. He’d seen how hard his parents worked every day as sharecroppers. \n', 'Growing up racism and bigotry were part of his everyday life. He knew deep in his \n', 'soul that something needed to change. So when he heard Dr. King on the radio \n', 'that day, his powerful words resonated with what John had already been feeling \n', 'all his life.\n', 'John felt fortified in his understanding that there are causes that one needs \n', 'to stand up for, even if it means getting into trouble: what he called “good trouble, \n', 'necessary trouble.” His first formal act of protest was a petition arguing that the \n', 'City Library of Troy should be open to all Black people. But what seems self-evi-\n', 'dent today didn’t even get a response back then.\n', 'That fall, when he hadn’t heard back from Dr. King, he decided to go to a \n', 'small Black college in Nashville, Tennessee. It was then that Dr. King invited him \n', 'to come for a visit, during his spring break. John vividly remembers the day he met \n', 'the legendary civil rights leader for the first time. “Are you the boy from Troy? Are \n', 'you John Lewis?” Dr. King said. And John answered, “I am John Robert Lewis,” \n', 'giving his full name. From that moment, he knew then that he wanted to follow in \n', 'Dr. King’s footsteps, and become active in the movement.\n', 'While in college, John became an active member of the Nashville Student \n', ' 144\n', 'Movement (NSM) and joined them in their fight for desegregating the city, as a \n', 'step toward racial equality and voting rights for the Black community. Voting \n', 'rights was an issue close to his heart: his great-great-grandfather was the first \n', 'person in his family to vote, in 1867, just as soon as he had been freed, as part of \n', 'the Reconstruction Act of 1867. It was more than a hundred years later that John \n', 'Lewis was the next person in his family to exercise his right to vote.\n', 'But before they could tackle such underlying questions of power, John and \n', 'his fellow activists had to turn to much more basic forms of discrimination. So, \n', 'along with other NSM members, he organized sit-ins at segregated diners and \n', 'department stores in Nashville. Every day at lunchtime, John and his fellow ac-\n', 'tivists would gather to simply be visible in public spaces. “We wanted them to see \n', 'us,” he said. “We wanted white people, everyday citizens, everyday customers to \n', 'be exposed to us, to see us as we were, not as something in their minds, in their \n', 'imaginations.”\n', 'As his activism made him an increasingly well-known figure in Nashville, \n', 'he was invited to study nonviolent action with Rev. James Lawson at the Clark \n', 'Memorial United Methodist Church. It was there that he became a dedicated be-\n', 'liever in its fundamental principles. He then applied to be one of the first Freedom \n', 'Riders—seven white and six Black activists who planned to travel together, on the \n', 'same bus, from Washington, DC to New Orleans. They knew that this strategic \n', 'act of protest could lead to their being attacked, and that they couldn’t count on \n', 'local police to protect them. These brave young men and women risked their lives \n', 'by just taking a bus ride to stand up against racial segregation, and in fact three of \n', 'them were abducted and murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan. John knew \n', 'two of them personally. Despite this horrific violence and sustained resistance \n', 'to their campaign, they were ultimately successful. In 1963, President Kennedy \n', 'announced that his administration would introduce the most expansive civil rights \n', 'bill the U.S. had ever seen. And John Lewis’s participation in the Freedom Rides, \n', 'and his being arrested 24 times for his involvement in nonviolent activism had \n', 'made him a celebrity, and a beacon of hope for the Black community, especially \n', 'among college students.\n', 'Buoyed by his experience, and his desire to engage many more Black youth, \n', 'John Lewis became a founding member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating \n', 'Committee (SNCC). He rallied them to join with Dr. King, Ralph Abernathy, A. \n', 'Philip Randolf, and Bayard Rustin to help organize the Civil Rights March on \n', 'Washington on August 28, 1963. Hundreds of thousands of people marched that \n', 'day to demand their civil and economic rights. And it was on that historic day that \n', '145\n', 'Dr. King’s iconic “I Have A Dream” speech fed their souls. John Lewis was the \n', 'youngest speaker that day. “We are tired,” he said. “We are tired of being beaten \n', 'by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jail over and over \n', 'again. And then you holler, ‘Be patient.’ How long can we be patient? We want \n', 'our freedom, and we want it now!”\n', 'As chairman of SNCC, John Lewis zeroed in on the fight to register Black \n', 'people to vote. The next year, he launched the “Mississippi: Freedom Summer” \n', 'campaign of 1964, to register as many Black voters as possible in order to change \n', 'the balance of power. He travelled across the country, cajoling college students to \n', 'get everyone they knew to register to vote so they could make their voices heard, \n', 'and fight for equal rights.\n', 'Then in 1965, when Dr. King invited him to lead the march from Mont-\n', 'gomery to Selma, Alabama, he proudly accepted this life-changing offer. Together \n', 'with his fellow activists, he fearlessly crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. \n', 'Police in riot gear were waiting for them. When the marchers stopped in front of \n', 'the police to pray, the police attacked. John Lewis was badly injured by a strike on \n', 'the head, the scars of which he bore for the rest of his life.\n', 'But he and his fellow activists continued protesting the pervasive racism \n', 'throughout American society. Eventually, as a politician he gained the power \n', 'needed to develop laws to strengthen the voting rights he’d fought for as a young \n', 'activist. He worked tirelessly on the bill that enshrined important protections \n', 'against racial biases that were part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But the bill \n', 'was never passed, due to opposition in the Senate. “It makes me sad,” he said. “It \n', 'makes me feel like crying when people are denied their right to vote.”\n', 'Until the end of his life, John Lewis continued to fight for the right to vote \n', 'for all Americans. Even in his 80s, he was sought after to speak at rallies across the \n', 'country. “You have been called to do something,” he would tell the crowds. “The \n', 'vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have for our democracy.”\n', 'As the representative for Georgia’s 5th District, he used his platform to chal-\n', 'lenge and mentor a younger generation to take over and carry on his legacy. From \n', 'their work on voter suppression to issues of prison reform and police brutality, as \n', 'well as the disproportionate effect of climate change on Black communities, he \n', 'was proud of the young activists who are speaking up today.\n', 'Until his death in July 2020, John Lewis had lived by a simple philosophy. \n', '“When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just—say something, do \n', 'something! Get in trouble, good trouble, necessary trouble!”\n', 'One of John Lewis’s greatest joys was seeing Barack Obama become Amer-\n', ' 146\n', 'ica’s first Black president. At his funeral President Obama said of him that he \n', '“brought this country a little bit closer to our highest ideals. You want to honor \n', 'John?

Destiny would watch the small monitor molded to the wall of the \n', 'school’s studio, and watch the video stream. “And I was like—I want to do that!” \n', 'Destiny said. “So I became the producer, and then an anchor, and reporter on the \n', 'show.

Destiny \n', 'joined the school’s newspaper, the Northridge Reporter, and was quickly promoted \n', 'to news editor. She wrote about issues of identity and race, as well as her high \n', 'school’s sports teams and musicals. Then one day in May of 2016 she was forced \n', 'to leave her high school—and her beloved newspaper. She pleaded with the ad-\n', 'ministration to let her stay; she was happy there, and she was an integral member \n', 'of the news team. “They just pushed the Black kids, for the most part, back to the \n', 'other side of the river,” Destiny says. “What’s happening in Tuscaloosa is, they are \n', 'resegregating schools. And they’re redlining.”\n', 'Destiny was assigned to Brown High School, a predominantly Black school. \n', 'Although she was promised that her new school would start a journalism program, \n', 'Destiny soon found out what that really meant.\n', '“The teacher who was supposed to teach it was informed that I would handle \n', 'the newspaper.

This wasn’t about me; it was about providing people with the \n', 'opportunity to explore a new career path.”\n', 'Many students in her high school came from difficult backgrounds, and \n', 'there was no real outlet for them, no one to tell their stories to. “The education \n', 'system in general is not meant for Black students,” Destiny says. “It’s not designed \n', 'for us, or by us.”\n', 'Destiny had also realized there was a lack of reporting on environmental \n', 'stories, like the stench emanating from the paper mill by her grandmother’s \n', 'house. She had always been fascinated by environmental stories, and she watched \n', 'National Geographic’s Animal Planet show almost every day. She knew a little bit \n', 'about climate change, but now she started to wonder who were the people that \n', 'were being the most affected. And where were their voices? “They don’t even \n', 'talk about people like me,” she says. “Usually, we’re impacted first and most by \n', 'everything.”\n', 'It was then that she discovered her passion for covering issues of environ-\n', 'mental justice. She wanted to tell the stories of those communities that were im-\n', 'pacted first, and worst, by climate change. “I made it my mission to do whatever \n', 'I could to use media as a form of narrative organizing,” she says. “To share the \n', 'stories of people from marginalized communities who were being impacted by \n', 'environmental inequity.”\n', 'Environmental issues are often reported on as a matter of protecting the \n', 'natural environment. For Destiny, that is short sighted, and incomplete. “We \n', 'need to broaden our awareness and look at how our health is being impacted by \n', 'environmental factors like clean air and water,” she says. “When we talk about \n', 'natural disasters, like Hurricane Katrina, we need to think about who lives in \n', 'those regions, and who is being impacted the worst; it is primarily people of color.”\n', 'The even greater injustice is that although people of color are dispropor-\n', 'tionately affected by climate change, they have historically been excluded from the \n', 'environmental movement, Destiny says.

And when educational networks \n', 'partake in community building around these issues, it creates a really cohesive \n', 'coalition going forward.”\n', 'Xiye gave a memorable TED Talk, which was framed as a letter to her abue-\n', 'la, her grandmother. “The world is so big, and it has so many bad habits,” she said. \n', '“I didn’t know how a 15-year-old was supposed to change anything, but I had to \n', 'try.” Reflecting back on her speech she says, “It was a way to share my story, my \n', 'frustration, my hopes and dreams for the future in a new way that I hoped would \n', 'influence people, because what we need is more people supporting this movement. \n', 'We especially need more youth to be involved as climate activists. If there were \n', 'more of us, none of us would have to be full-time activists.”\n', 'Wherever Xiye goes, she finds youth eager to get involved but they don’t \n', 'know how or where to start. For them, she has some guidance. “It doesn’t matter \n', 'what your gift or passion is in life. We need youth from all walks, because diversity \n', 'of thinking and skills is what is going to make solutions possible. Any skill that \n', ' 154\n', 'you have can be used to address the climate crisis; whether you are an architect, \n', 'photographer, educator, scientist, or activist, we could use your skills because we \n', 'need all the skills to face up to this emergency.”\n', 'That said, she cautions youth to avoid the pressure to change who they are \n', 'to fit into a particular role. “Be who you are, know yourself, and ask yourself what \n', 'you can add,” she says. “If you don’t find anything that fits you, just Google a \n', 'cause that you are interested in supporting and get involved. If there’s nothing, \n', 'come up with it yourself. It’s true that a lot of times there are no spaces for us at \n', 'the table to share our voices and opinions. And if you can’t find a seat at the table, \n', 'just build your own table! You will make an impact, because youth always do. We \n', 'have more influence than we think we do, and we need to take advantage of that.”\n', 'For adults, Xiye doesn’t necessarily want support for the youth as much as \n', 'she wants support for the overall climate movement. “The youth grow really fast. \n', 'I started out at 15, and in a snap of my fingers, I’m 19. And I’ve left my youth \n', 'behind. I had a lot of great things to say as a youth, and I was heard by plenty of \n', 'adults. But what it boils down to is that the youth can’t vote. So when adults work \n', 'to amplify the demands of youth, to be heard in their circles of influence, that’s \n', 'great, and we are grateful for that. But when you vote for what we want, that really \n', 'makes an impact. Beyond that, if you have the means, support us. And if you \n', 'don’t, get out there and organize–that doesn’t cost anything. Both are important. \n', 'We are going to need all the help we can get to face up to this crisis of our age.”\n', 'To her family, and her ever-supportive grandmother, the words she spoke \n', 'under the bright lights at TED still ring true. “Thank you for inviting me to love \n', 'the world since the moment I was born.” With this love, she will devote her life to \n', 'making this earth a better place for everyone.

Growing up, Nicki had seen how her people had rallied against \n', 'the multinational mega-mining operations in the oil-rich province of Chubut that \n', 'were irreparably polluting the waterways, air, and farmland, and devastating the \n', 'local economies of these rural regions. That was ten years ago - and Argentinians \n', 'are still trying to slow the exploitation of the people’s lands.\n', 'When she was 15, Nicki joined her first strike, for International Women’s \n', 'Day. “Through this work, I began to be more aware of other issues—mainly, how \n', 'there is no climate justice without justice for women and social justice,” she says, \n', 'and adds, “It’s all intertwined.”\n', 'Then in 2019, she saw online how young people in Europe were banding to-\n', 'gether through the climate movement Fridays for Future. Ever curious, she start-\n', 'ed researching the environmental issues that were facing her country, and those \n', 'she’d heard about at the strikes. She quickly realized the scale and severity of \n', 'the environmental problems Argentina was facing. She learned about the role of \n', 'climate change in creating more severe heat waves and longer, more devastating \n', 'droughts—which were responsible for the fires that in 2020 burned over 1 million \n', 'acres of land, and nearly another 100,000 acres in 2021 in Argentina. She also \n', 'learned about the brewing humanitarian situations occurring at mega-mining \n', 'sites all over the country. “I knew right then that my work had to be focused on \n', 'climate action. But clearly, fighting for the environment is not just about demand-\n', 'ing a reduction in greenhouse gases. It’s also about demanding climate justice for \n', 'the most vulnerable among us.”\n', ' 156\n', 'The more Nicki learned how pressing the crisis was for Argentinians, the \n', 'more she couldn’t understand why people in her country weren’t talking about \n', 'it. In fact, she wondered why young people in other parts of the world had in-\n', 'formation she didn’t have. Why don’t schools, universities, and media outlets in \n', 'Argentina talk about the climate crisis if it’s so important? “At the beginning of \n', 'my journey I got really motivated to find answers,” she says. “Seeing all these \n', 'white Europeans, I was very aware of the lack of a Latin American perspective \n', 'in the movement. Greta Thunberg got me thinking that we should try to create a \n', 'movement in Argentina.”\n', 'So she formed Jovenes Por El Clima–Youth for Climate Argentina (YFCA)—\n', 'to engage young Argentinians who were concerned about climate change to join \n', 'with Greta and young activists around the world who were bringing the spotlight \n', 'to the youth movement. In September 2019, for the first Global Climate Strike, \n', 'YFCA organized climate rallies of 5,000, 10,000, and 45,000 people, across Ar-\n', 'gentina. “It wasn’t easy to pull it off. But it was worth it in the end. With this kind \n', 'of turnout, we showed our government officials that we the people care about \n', 'remedying the climate situation. And we sent a message: the people have the \n', 'power to change anything we want.”\n', 'Empowered by this momentum, Nicki and her YFCA team finally got Ar-\n', 'gentinian leaders to listen to their demands and declare the country to be in a state \n', 'of climate emergency. It was the first nation in Latin America to do so, and it set \n', 'the stage for wide-sweeping reforms in the country. Later that year, the govern-\n', 'ment signed a bill to create a committee of scientists, experts, youth leaders, and \n', 'businesses to help guide the country to a more green and sustainable future.\n', 'For her pioneering work, Nicki was invited to travel to Madrid in December \n', '2019 to be a representative at COP25, the Conference of Parties to the United \n', 'Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). One of the \n', 'highlights for her was the opportunity to meet with the first woman president of \n', 'Chile, Michelle Bachelet, who now serves as the United Nations Commissioner \n', 'for Human Rights. “It was an opportunity for the media in Argentina to see a \n', 'youth leader from their country on TV speaking about these issues,” she says, and \n', 'adds, “I thought perhaps I could get them talking about the climate crisis back \n', 'home.”\n', 'Nicki’s voice continues to be heard both in her country and around the \n', 'world.

Without legislation, Nic-\n', 'ki doesn’t see a sustainable future. “We need our activism to lead to legislative \n', 'change in the energy sector,” she says. “A just transition takes time, and it’s time \n', 'that we don’t have.”\n', 'Nicki firmly believes we need specific legislative priorities on cleaner energy, \n', 'plastic pollution, and multinational mining operations. “Even if every individual \n', 'in Argentina does all of the things we are demanding, we are not going to change \n', 'the climate crisis.

People in her Latinx community \n', 'are twice as likely to live below the poverty line as those in white communities. As \n', 'a result, they are more likely to suffer from health problems, and also less likely to \n', 'graduate from high school and go on to escape poverty: a vicious cycle.\n', 'The deep-seated poverty in Oxnard created challenges for Carmen. She \n', 'was introduced to violence at an early age. There was domestic violence in her \n', 'family; gang violence in her community; police violence in the streets that often \n', '159\n', 'targeted her family members, specifically her older brothers, because of the way \n', 'they looked. Drug and alcohol abuse negatively impacted families, and racism \n', 'often showed up in their contact with police, and in high school.\n', 'Then, right before her 17th birthday, Carmen’s older sister was killed in a \n', 'one vehicular car accident. Her sister and Carmen were one day and two years \n', 'apart, and she was killed right before her 19th birthday, and buried on Carmen’s \n', '17th birthday.\n', 'Carmen’s relationship with her sister had been challenging. While Carmen \n', 'focused on sports and schoolwork, her sister got involved in hanging out with \n', 'the wrong crowd, which led to tension at home. Often having to chaperone her \n', 'sister, Carmen would stick to the sidelines, dribbling her basketball and not saying \n', 'much. But they were close in age, shared a room and a very special bond that was \n', 'unbreakable.\n', 'Her sister’s death put everything into perspective for Carmen. “She went \n', 'out with her friends one night and never came back home,” she says. “That be-\n', 'came the catalyst that changed my life, and is what made me want to change the \n', 'world. Losing her made me realize that life was too short and you couldn’t wait \n', 'for tomorrow to do what you could today. So I made a decision to live life to the \n', 'fullest from that moment on.”\n', 'As Carmen and her siblings suffered in the wake of her sister’s death, their \n', 'parents had to support them unconditionally, to love them and help them through \n', 'their pain. And her parents stayed strong. They found it in themselves to perform \n', 'an act of astonishing forgiveness: they decided not to press charges against the \n', 'person who had taken their daughter’s life. “At the time, I didn’t understand my \n', 'parents’ decision, but looking back, that was my first exposure to restorative jus-\n', 'tice,” she says.\n', 'Carmen embarked on her journey by enrolling at the local community \n', 'college and playing basketball, and she went on from there to the University of \n', 'California, Santa Cruz. There, she suddenly found herself exposed to a different \n', 'sort of crowd—one where both privilege and resistance came together in different \n', 'ways. She enrolled in a class on Chicana feminism, and studied with some of the \n', 'great activists and scholars of the protest and feminist movements: Aida Hurtado, \n', 'Angela Davis, Craig Haney, and others.\n', 'Unlike many of her peers, Carmen had to pay her own way through college \n', 'by working multiple jobs. But this opened up unexpected opportunities. She began \n', 'to work at the Youth Community Restoration Project, where she helped mentor \n', 'young people coming out of the justice system by getting them jobs and creating \n', ' 160\n', 'leadership opportunities for them. She also cofounded Girlzpace, which provided \n', 'gender-responsive services for girls in the community. Ultimately she went on to \n', 'work at the Santa Cruz County Probation Department to serve girls within the \n', 'system, and do system accountability. Like Carmen, some of the girls had a vision \n', 'of a different sort of future for themselves—one not defined by violence, but by \n', 'resistance to it.\n', 'Through this work Carmen came into contact with the organization Barrios \n', 'Unidos, and its founder, Nane Alejandrez. Nane had founded the organization \n', 'in 1977, and he had a radical idea: instead of isolating and locking up young \n', 'people who had committed crimes, he said, we should listen to them and support \n', 'them with the tools to succeed. Returning from Vietnam, where he had seen the \n', 'injustice and cruelty of war firsthand, he saw injustice echoed at home through \n', 'mass incarceration. Thirty-five members of his family had been behind bars—an \n', 'entire generation locked up and forgotten.\n', 'Nane saw a spark in Carmen; he brought her on board, and became some-\n', 'thing of a father figure and mentor for her. He was a humble and fair person, and \n', 'expected a lot from her, but he also supported her and knew she was destined for \n', 'greatness. “I was able to really learn from him,” she says. “He didn’t have to tell \n', 'me what his ideology was or what his theory of change was; you could see it in his \n', 'mannerisms, in the way in which he lived, and led.”\n', 'For example, when Nane would be invited to be a keynote speaker some-\n', 'where, he wouldn’t be on stage waiting for the guests to come in, but in the aisles \n', 'welcoming them, as an usher would. Nane embodied servant leadership, and Car-\n', 'men saw how people responded to this kind of warmth, which led her to bring it \n', 'to her own work later on.\n', 'During the 1990s the need for organizing around criminal justice issues was \n', 'increasing in the United States. The War on Drugs saw the prison population sky-\n', 'rocket across the country, and communities like Carmen’s were the most affected. \n', 'She made it her mission to right these wrongs, and fight against the injustice she \n', 'saw.\n', 'One day Nane introduced Carmen to one of his mentors, Harry Belafonte, \n', 'who was partnering with him on prison reform for black and brown youth. The \n', 'beloved Jamaican singer and actor, a friend of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was \n', 'a legend in the Civil Rights movement. He had raised millions of dollars by en-\n', 'gaging other celebrities to perform at his fundraisers. His generosity was so pure, \n', 'and so unwavering, that Coretta Scott King, an activist in her own right, said, \n', '“Whenever we got into trouble, or when tragedy struck, Harry has always come to \n', '161\n', 'our aid, his generous heart wide open.”\n', 'When Harry and Carmen met, they immediately hit it off. Soon after, Harry \n', 'asked Carmen to join his organization, The Gathering for Justice, as a founding \n', 'member, and move to New York City. The Gathering for Justice grounded com-\n', 'munities in the ideology of Dr. King—Kingian Nonviolence—and was embark-\n', 'ing on building a national movement to end child incarceration.\n', 'The introduction to Mr. Belafonte brought Carmen’s activism to a whole \n', 'new level, and gave her the opportunity to fight for real, structural change in com-\n', 'munities across the country that had long suffered from inequity, discrimination, \n', 'and the legacies of racism and slavery. But she never lost sight of the lessons she \n', 'had learned from Nane. “The movement is not about one individual, it’s about \n', 'building collective power,” she says. “There are times when even though you’ve \n', 'not done something, it is your responsibility as a moral leader to repair the harm \n', 'that’s been done.”\n', 'Carmen’s star as an activist was on the rise after she founded Justice League \n', 'NYC, a manifestation of The Gathering for Justice, when in 2014 another tragedy \n', 'struck, and moved her activism into another arena. That summer, she went to Fer-\n', 'guson, Missouri, where a week earlier, an unarmed black man, Michael Brown Jr., \n', 'had been shot by police, sparking protests that would eventually spread across the \n', 'city, and the nation. When she landed in Ferguson, the August heat was oppressive, \n', 'ominous. That day, her phone rang: it was a call from back home. Her nephew, \n', 'just 22 years old, had cancer. “That became the second catalyst for me,” she says. \n', '“It gave me this sense of urgency, and again the feeling that life was too short.”\n', 'In Oxnard, which is one of the country’s top strawberry-picking regions, \n', 'pesticides sprayed by large-scale fruit farms waft across the countryside and into \n', 'the respiratory systems of the people who live, work, and go to school there. Al-\n', 'though it is not known how her nephew got cancer, the school that he attended is \n', 'right across the road from one of these farms. Breathing those toxic fumes was not \n', 'healthy for anyone who lived nearby.\n', 'Latinx farmworkers in California have long fought for the state to recognize \n', 'the harm inflicted upon them by agricultural practices. They took their case to \n', 'court, suing the California Department of Pesticide Regulation for discrimination, \n', 'because the chemicals that are sprayed disproportionately affect Latinx commu-\n', 'nities. After a decade-long battle, they won; and the Environmental Protection \n', 'Agency was forced to restrict its chemical use.\n', 'Carmen’s nephew’s illness, and his daily fight to live forced Carmen to real-\n', 'ize that invisible, insidious attacks on the environment can play just as big a role \n', ' 162\n', 'in perpetuating inequity as overt violence and discrimination. “When I got the \n', 'news about my nephew, I realized that this movement was not just about criminal \n', 'justice reform, or police brutality,” she says. “It’s about environmental justice. It’s \n', 'about immigration reform. It’s about all these other things that impact us all.”\n', '“One of the teachings from Barrios Unidos that we talk about is honoring \n', 'Mother Earth, and also honoring our spirit,” she says. “It’s all interconnected. \n', 'It’s all valuable.

While her teachers would mention climate \n', 'change as a theoretical problem, the reality of it never really hit home until she \n', 'was older.\n', 'But what she didn’t get from her school, she got from her father. As a mem-\n', '165\n', 'ber of the Kampala Rotary Club, he often went on tree-planting missions to \n', 'communities across Uganda. This inspired Vanessa as she grew older and became \n', 'more independent. Curious to learn more, she started watching the news and do-\n', 'ing her own research. She was shocked to see the devastation that climate change \n', 'had already wrought on Uganda and neighboring countries like the Democratic \n', 'Republic of the Congo.\n', 'In the Congolese rainforests, trees were already losing their ability to capture \n', 'carbon because of higher temperatures and long-term drought. In the next 15 \n', 'years, according to scientists, the trees will be unable to capture any CO2, which \n', 'could irreversibly impact biodiversity, and the environment generally. Then in \n', '2019, when the Congo basin—the second largest rainforest in the world, after the \n', 'Amazon—caught fire, Vanessa saw just how dangerous climate change could be, \n', 'not just for African countries, but for the entire world.\n', 'Vanessa soon began to understand how climate change was affecting her on \n', 'a personal level. In her own country, which is still largely agricultural, she learned \n', 'about how droughts have already affected farmers, and how that in turn has im-\n', 'pacted her own family’s consumption habits. With higher temperatures, farmers \n', 'can’t produce as much grain and other staple foods; what they do produce, they \n', 'are forced to sell at higher prices to make up for the loss.\n', '“I may not be affected directly, because my parents are the ones who buy the \n', 'food at home, but there are nearby communities where the less privileged don’t \n', 'even have the ability to get food or access to clean water when these disasters \n', 'strike,” she says.\n', 'Vanessa decided that despite her natural shyness, she just had to take a stand. \n', 'So, inspired by the brave activism of Swedish student Greta Thunberg, she stood \n', 'outside, in front of the Ugandan parliament building to call for more climate \n', 'action. It wasn’t until she stepped out of her house that she realized just how easy \n', 'it was to make a difference. “The moment you step out, I don’t even know where \n', 'the fear goes, but it actually goes away,” she says. “The only way to overcome your \n', 'fears is to confront them.”\n', 'For months, Vanessa’s protest was a solitary one. She carried a simple sign \n', 'with four lines printed on it:\n', '“Green love, green peace.” \n', '“Beat Plastic, Polythene, Pollution.” \n', '“Thanks for the global warming.” \n', '“Climate Strike Now.”\n', ' 166\n', 'At first, she dealt with a lot of hostility. People would yell things at her from \n', 'their cars, saying that she was wasting her time. After a while, however, others \n', 'began to join her cause.

In all, Vanessa has now participated in more than 60 Fri-\n', 'days for Future marches, mostly in Uganda, but also at the United Nations Youth \n', 'Climate Summit, at COP25 in Madrid, and at Davos, where she was invited to \n', 'join other climate activists from around the world.\n', 'She also joined with other activists to form a movement called Youth for \n', 'Future Africa.

33,Illai Kenney,Sustainability For Black Communities,168,172,"['Sustainability For Black Communities\n', 'Illai Kenney | Georgia / Washington, DC\n', 'From a very young age Illai Kenney understood the connection between \n', 'sustainability and her identity as a Black woman. Her mother, Felicia Davis, was \n', 'working in the sustainability field: she would often bring home magazines from \n', 'work with articles about global warming and climate change. Illai was intrigued, \n', 'and she was always curious to learn more—and find ways she could get involved \n', 'to help remedy the situation. But at school, when she read her science textbooks, \n', 'she didn’t find much about these issues.\n', 'Illai was troubled. She knew that Black communities like hers are the most \n', 'negatively impacted by global warming and climate change. And as a young per-\n', 'son, she was outraged that the planet, and her right to a healthy, sustainable future, \n', 'was being ruined by decisions made by an older generation disconnected from her \n', 'reality. “We are the ones who are going to be the most impacted by the decisions \n', 'being made today,” she said. “But what recourse do we children have? We can’t \n', 'vote. We can’t run for office.” Thinking back on it now, years later, she says, “It \n', ' 168\n', 'was a daunting realization to come to.”\n', 'So, at age 12, Illai and her friends created the nonprofit organization, Geor-\n', 'gia Kids Against Pollution (KAP), to do something about it. She wanted to be a \n', 'bridge between her friends and those who were engaged with more visible social \n', 'issues, like gun violence and voting rights, than with environmental activism.\n', 'Illai had grown up around community organizing, and had seen how pro-\n', 'testing can help people get their voices heard. “I had a knack for finding common \n', 'ground. And I did a lot of organizing,” she says. Still, she needed a little guidance. \n', '“So we went to the adults in our lives, who helped us flesh out our ideas, and \n', 'prepare us for some of the challenges we would meet with KAP. The environment \n', 'was affecting us, giving young kids in our neighborhood asthma. These things \n', 'were affecting us, but we really didn’t understand,” she says. “Things like carbon \n', 'dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and mercury, were being put out into the air by power \n', 'plants and major pollutants. They cause smog; they cause global warming; they \n', 'cause acid rain, which in turn affects us. These power plants dump pollutants into \n', 'low-income areas.” And she added, “Somebody needs to let the people who live \n', 'there know that yes, you do have a choice; you aren’t forced to live with this stuff. \n', 'And you can make a difference if you want to.”\n', 'In 2003, when she was just 13 years old, Illai led the first KAP protest, held \n', 'outside of the Southern Company, a gas and utility corporation based in Geor-\n', 'gia. “Our demonstration actually made it into the shareholders report,” she says \n', 'proudly. “This gigantic corporation actually heard our concerns about alternative \n', 'energy. At the time, I didn’t realize it was such an effective action.” She smiles, and \n', 'adds, “I started small. And I still haven’t let up in the fight.”\n', 'That same year, Illai received the prestigious Brower Youth Award, which \n', 'is given each year to six youth environmental leaders across the country. “Despite \n', 'the struggles of organizing, that really gave me validation,” she says. The following \n', 'year, Illai joined her mother at the U.N. Conference on Sustainable Development \n', 'in Johannesburg, South Africa. She was eager to learn about how people around \n', 'the world were being affected by environmental issues, and what they were doing \n', 'to find solutions. “At the conference, I saw firsthand how communities of color \n', 'face the same issues wherever we are on the planet; economic issues, social justice \n', 'issues, environmental issues.” She adds, “Environmental issues are often the last \n', 'ones to be talked about.”\n', 'The visibility from the Brower Youth Award led to a nonprofit organization, \n', 'Corporate Accountability International, reaching out to Illai when she was 16. \n', 'They wanted to partner with her on some advocacy work at a Coca Cola interna-\n', '169\n', 'tional shareholder’s meeting. Illai spoke on behalf of farmers in India who were \n', 'having their local groundwater supplies devastated by the company. She asked a \n', 'roomful of shareholders what they planned to do when young people refused to \n', 'buy Coca-Cola due to their abusive water practices in India. Shortly thereafter or-\n', 'ganizers succeeded in getting Coca Cola to shut down two of the most predatory \n', 'plants in India, which were impoverishing local communities. “Getting involved \n', 'with shareholder advocacy opened up a new world of ways to engage civically,” \n', 'she says. “Today it’s a common tactic, but back then, there wasn’t much conversa-\n', 'tion around this sort of engagement.”\n', 'When it was time for college, Illai chose Howard University, her mother’s \n', 'alma mater, in Washington, DC as the place she wanted to further her studies in \n', 'communications. While at Howard, she interned with the university’s Office of \n', 'Sustainability. That’s when she discovered the gaping holes in support for sustain-\n', 'able development among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), \n', 'especially around tech, solar energy, and green education issues. “The expertise \n', 'that a lot of universities take for granted—HBCUs just don’t have access to that,” \n', 'she says. So she set about changing that too, step by step, as she always had.\n', 'As a project manager in the Office of Sustainability Illai helped support \n', 'projects like the installation of solar panels on buildings at Howard; green energy \n', 'retrofits around the campus; the formation of a full- scale recycling program; and \n', 'an organic garden with a composting program. Each of these projects was a huge \n', 'step toward creating a more sustainable university. However, each project was \n', 'also a standalone project. This awareness challenged Illai to think about bigger \n', 'questions concerning the nature of longer-term sustainable growth.\n', 'In partnership with her mother, Illai cofounded the HBCU Green Fund, to \n', 'create a capital infrastructure for long-term sustainable growth projects to gener-\n', 'ate money for HBCUs. Their strategy is to support projects that reduce energy \n', 'and water usage on HBCU campuses – which creates financial savings, which \n', 'are then reinvested into more sustainable projects and infrastructure. Illai hopes \n', 'that it will also inspire a whole new generation of African American students to \n', 'appreciate the value of green living.\n', 'In all of her successes, Illai is always quick to recognize the tremendous \n', 'legacy she inherited from her family, who were among the most forward- think-\n', 'ing environmentalists, at a time when such thinking was in its infancy. “My \n', 'great-grandmother was the greatest conservationist and communicator,” she says. \n', '“She mastered so many of the strategies that are just now becoming common—re-\n', 'cycling, urban agriculture, living simply, investing wisely—and also, the power of \n', ' 170\n', 'proactive community engagement.”\n', 'Illai’s mother, Felicia Davis, continues to be a leading voice for advancing \n', 'sustainability in the HBCU community and beyond. At the United Negro College \n', 'Fund, she has created impactful projects like the Building Green Initiative, which \n', 'has helped Black, Hispanic-serving, and tribal colleges move toward a more sus-\n', 'tainable future. In the early 2000s, Felicia carried on her family’s legacy when she \n', 'started a network of eco-cyber centers in rural Ghana, South Africa, and Senegal. \n', 'She has also used technology to create powerful cultural exchanges and environ-\n', 'mental stewardship programs, through projects like beach and village cleanups.\n', 'This dynamic mother and daughter duo are frequent spokespersons who \n', 'represent communities of color at predominantly white conferences like Project \n', 'Drawdown. They also ensure that they are not the only Black voices in white spac-\n', 'es by securing funding for other Black leaders to join them. “While there’s a legacy \n', 'that runs down from my great- grandmother, to my mother, to me, that sense of \n', 'stewardship is not only for my family, or my community alone. It should extend \n', 'out globally in our actions, far beyond ourselves and our own communities.”\n', 'For youth who want to pursue a path in sustainability, Illai has some practi-\n', 'cal advice. “What I tend to tell young people is that every day, we all make choices. \n', 'And the worlds we create are a reflection of the choices we make.” Responsible \n', 'choices create responsible individuals – and ultimately, this creates responsible \n', 'communities.\n', 'Illai wants young people to understand how their actions can reach far be-\n', 'yond wherever they started. In her eyes, it’s important to be informed about what \n', 'you want to pursue as a youth, because knowledge leads to better choices, and \n', 'better choices lead to empowerment.

I got \n', 'to see how excited people were to cast their vote. For many of them it was the \n', 'first vote they had ever cast in their lives that really mattered.” For over 30 years, \n', 'Kenya had been ruled by the Kenya African National Union (KANU), in a one \n', 'party system. Until that fateful day, the people of Kenya had no say in their future.\n', 'When Scott was 8 years old his father joined the State Department. His \n', 'family left their home in San Diego to experience the world. Frequent travel was \n', 'part and parcel of growing up for Scott. He was constantly moving about, expe-\n', 'riencing different people, languages, cultures, and most importantly, systems of \n', 'government. By the time he was 16, he had been all around the United States and \n', 'Latin America. It’s been said that travel helps create a charitable mind. He credits \n', 'his most formative experiences to living on the African continent.\n', '“When you are living in a place without a democracy, things can be scary. \n', 'People see that the democratic effort is towards good. But they doubt that a de-\n', 'mocracy could actually thrive, since it never had.”\n', 'Scott would hold these lessons close to his heart; the main one being, democ-\n', 'racy is fragile. This is something he wasn’t taught in school when he was young, \n', 'and it troubled him, considering how important a concept this was. From that \n', 'point forward, he made it his mission in life to ensure that more young people in \n', 'the United States were civically educated and engaged.\n', 'When Scott returned to the U.S., he attended Brown University. Here, he \n', 'immediately got interested in learning all that he could about international poli-\n', 'tics on campus. By the end of his senior year, he felt like he had the tools to start \n', 'a civic movement of his own.\n', '183\n', '“A lot of young people want to make a difference, but don’t necessarily see \n', 'politics and local government as the best way to do so. There are a whole host of \n', 'reasons for this. And people can be cynical about politics. But I think the main \n', 'reason is that young people don’t understand how these systems work – because \n', 'we don’t teach civics in schools anymore. And when we do, it’s boring. It’s like - \n', 'how a bill becomes a law, that kind of approach.”\n', 'So it made Scott wonder, how do we bring civics back to the classroom? \n', 'How do we get young people excited about participating in a democracy? We \n', 'need a new approach, and it needs to be action-oriented. It needs to bring young \n', 'people to politics by engaging them in issues they care about. From here, while still \n', 'a senior at Brown, he co-founded with Anna Ninan Generation Citizen (GC) to \n', 'ensure that every student in the United States receives an effective action-oriented \n', 'civics education.\n', 'In September 2008, they had their first success in Rhode Island schools, \n', 'serving 300 students. In a year, they had offices in the Greater Boston area. By \n', '2010, they had won a prestigious Echoing Green Fellowship for their work.\n', '“We work with high schools to ensure that students take action civics, just like \n', 'they would science or math. In our curriculum, they learn about local issues, and \n', 'then take real plans of action to local government. It’s getting at the root cause of \n', 'a problem, and addressing it through the process from start to finish,” Scott adds, \n', '“But it isn’t always easy.”\n', '“I organized my first event when I was 23. We were working with the Provi-\n', 'dence Public School District, and all seemed well. That is, until I realized I messed \n', 'up the bus registration process – and I did. It wasn’t a small error. I was repri-\n', 'manded. I felt incompetent. And more than anything, I felt so bad that an action \n', 'of mine would take away any of the spotlight from these amazing youth leaders. \n', 'It took me a lot of time to rebuild that relationship. But it was important that I \n', 'recognized it was on me, and to get better. There was a bigger cause to serve out \n', 'there.”\n', '“GC is a great organization, but I’ve made many mistakes along the way. \n', 'Going through the ups and downs is what got me where I am today.” Scott recalls \n', 'another struggle he had. It occurred when he was lobbying at the state house of \n', 'Rhode Island for divestment from Sudan, which was suffering from the genocide \n', 'in Darfur. “While I was lobbying on the floor, a treasurer came by and said “this is \n', 'a cute student project,” – they didn’t take me seriously at all. It made me feel like \n', 'I was too young. Like I wasn’t going to succeed. It can be hard to push forward \n', 'without support. But I learned from this experience, and applied it to GC. When \n', ' 184\n', 'you start a nonprofit, there are countless obstacles. You are always worried about \n', 'having enough funds to support your cause, so you are always trying to raise funds. \n', 'Because of this, you are living in a world of rejection, and you have to be able to \n', 'deal with that. It’s hard too, when it seems like more people should care about the \n', 'issue that you care about. Having a greater cause in mind helps.”\n', 'Scott describes the culmination of Generation Citizen’s curriculum, where \n', 'students really have the chance to shine. “We have a Civics Day that takes place \n', 'at the end of the Fall and Spring semesters in each of our program sites. It’s \n', 'kind of like a science fair for civics, where our students present their action civics \n', 'projects to the community, local officials, and community leaders who bridge the \n', 'gap between them. It’s a great place to see young people taking civic action.”\n', 'GC has a policy and advocacy component. It tries to ensure that action civ-\n', 'ics is a need- to-have in curriculums across the nation. A major advocacy issue of \n', 'GC is their push for legislation to lower the voting age to 16. Scott believes that if \n', 'younger people were going to be voting, schools would be much more motivated \n', 'to properly provide civics education. “Our country has dismal voter participation, \n', 'especially recently,” says Scott adding, “Lowering the voting age is a necessary \n', 'reform that’s needed for spurring higher voter participation, more education, and \n', 'more civic engagement.”\n', 'This year alone, 30,000 students across the country have been engaged in \n', 'action civics with GC. With offices in New York, Oakland, Massachusetts, Rhode \n', 'Island, California, Oklahoma, and Texas, it might be easy to think Scott was an \n', 'instant success. But this isn’t the case.\n', 'Scott wants young people to know one thing about themselves – they hold a \n', 'great amount of power. “Every time we have seen a positive change in this coun-\n', 'try, youth have been at the forefront. Whether it was the Civil Rights Movement, \n', 'or Climate Change Advocacy, the youth have led the way where others wouldn’t. \n', 'So I believe it’s up to young people to build a better democracy than the one we \n', 'have today.”\n', 'And he has all the faith in the world that they will. Especially when they are \n', 'supported by strong adult leadership. “For too long, we’ve heard it said that young \n', 'people have to wait their turn. We’ve heard that they don’t have anything valuable \n', 'to add to a conversation. We’ve heard that young people should wait until they are \n', 'older, when they can really understand the way things work. To this sort of think-\n', 'ing? Well, I would just say that we need more of the unique knowledge that young \n', 'people have out there. We need to hear more of their points of view. More of \n', 'their abilities to unify people. And we need to support them now, more than ever.”\n', '185\n', 'In all of his work, Scott has demonstrated an amazing capacity to unify \n', 'people through civic education. GC has acted as a bridge between organizations, \n', 'and has brought many differing causes together. With its Community Change \n', 'Fellowship, GC has funded students to partner with causes around the country. \n', 'Those include YouthUprising (Bay Area), Make The Road New York, and the \n', 'Boston Education Justice Alliance.\n', 'GC has countless alumni still making an impact by carrying on the tenets of \n', 'civic education.

Looking into the audience, he could see his mother clapping along with \n', 'everyone else, wiping tears from her face as he accepted the award. Sitting right \n', 'in front of her was Malala Yousafzai, the young Nobel Peace Prize winner, who \n', 'had just introduced him. It was an emotional high point for Mohamad, part of his \n', 'long journey away from his home in Syria to his new life in Sweden.\n', 'The road that brought Mohamad to this moment had actually begun in \n', 'Lebanon, where he and his family had fled for safety in 2013. Mohamed was 12 \n', 'at the time, and the adjustment was difficult for him. When he, his mother and \n', 'uncle had arrived in Lebanon, they had a house and a roof over their heads, but \n', 'it didn’t feel like home to him. His father had had to stay back in Syria, so Moha-\n', 'mad’s family was torn apart. In Syria, Mohamad’s world had been built around \n', 'his school, his family, and his friends. In Aley, the city where his family now settled, \n', 'he didn’t know anyone his age.\n', 'There was no school for Mohamad in Aley because government regulations \n', 'did not permit Syrian children to attend Lebanese schools. So, without school or \n', 'friends, Mohamad’s social life disappeared. As any young person would, Moha-\n', 'mad struggled and felt very alone.\n', 'Climate change had forced thousands of Syrians to leave their homes and \n', 'become refugees in Lebanon. Since farmers in Syria use only the rain—not ir-\n', 'rigation—to water their crops, they are especially vulnerable to climate change. \n', 'And since droughts are increasing—from once every 55 years, to once every seven \n', 'years—it’s hard for them to survive. Most of the farmers and unskilled laborers \n', 'who fled Syria to go to Lebanon ended up in the Beqaa Valley. And even if the \n', ' 200\n', 'conflict in Syria ends, many can’t go back there, since climate change has ravaged \n', 'their lands.\n', 'While Mohamad was home, without school, he discovered photography.\n', 'His father had introduced him to a well-known photographer, Ramzi Haid-\n', 'ar, who mentored Mohamad like his own son. It was the first time Mohamad had \n', 'ever touched a camera. He loved photography because it helped him to see and \n', 'appreciate the details of his new environment, as well as the wide range of human \n', 'emotions in a new light. Over the years, Mohamad’s photography has evolved: \n', 'he’s now produced three documentaries as well.\n', 'One day, he went with his mother and uncle to volunteer at a nearby refugee \n', 'camp. They brought food, clothing and materials to build tents. Mohamad was \n', 'too young to help the volunteers distribute everything, so he played with the chil-\n', 'dren who were living in the camp. After visiting several times, Mohamad made \n', 'new friends with children there. He soon realized that his volunteer work was a \n', 'two-way street. While he was helping them, doing something positive also made \n', 'him feel happy again: he liked being able to do something useful and productive. \n', 'He encouraged the children to take photos, and showed them how to do it so they \n', 'could share their stories. “These kids are too shy to talk, but they can take photos,” \n', 'Mohamad says. “They can create images of home, pictures of happiness.”\n', 'Mohamad started thinking about how he could do something more mean-\n', 'ingful, something that would help the children in the camp in a more significant \n', 'way. So, he decided to start his own school. At first, the “school” was very basic. \n', 'There were not many resources to work with. The school consisted of tents that \n', 'volunteers put up with their own hands. To begin, his family pooled their knowl-\n', 'edge to teach classes at the school. His mother taught math; his uncle taught \n', 'Arabic. And even though he was only 12, Mohamad taught the English classes.\n', 'On the very first day, Mohamad was thrilled to see that 100 children showed \n', 'up! To make room for everyone they had to hold different classes throughout the \n', 'day. They taught classes from 8:00 in the morning until 8:00 at night, so everyone \n', 'who wanted to could have a chance to learn.\n', 'With the school project, Mohamad finally felt like he had a new home. And \n', 'he had discovered his own form of activism as well.\n', 'From a young age, activism and revolution been part of his family’s life. His \n', 'mother was an active political organizer, and both of his parents had protested in \n', 'the Syrian revolution. Their living room was a hub of activity: there were always \n', 'activists coming and going from their home. Mohamad didn’t fully understand \n', 'what was happening at the time, but he understood that this was important work. \n', '201\n', '“From watching my parents, I started envisioning what it means to be an activist; \n', 'how you socialize with other people, how you build social networks,” he says.\n', 'He also came to understand that it was dangerous work: his mother was \n', 'arrested twice for her organizing activities. After her second arrest, she was told \n', 'she had a week to leave the country, or she would be arrested and killed. That’s \n', 'when Mohamad fled Syria with his family.\n', 'But for Mohamad, revolution is not just about protesting what is wrong. \n', '“Revolution is also about building a community,” he says. And it is about fighting \n', 'for positive ideas and values.\n', 'So, to expand the school they had started, Mohamad reached out to family \n', 'friends from Syria who now lived in Germany and asked them for help. Soon \n', 'schools all around Germany were sending school supplies and monetary dona-\n', 'tions. He named this initiative Kids for Kids. After a while, this new partnership \n', 'started to get media attention, and with the additional exposure came more re-\n', 'sources.\n', 'Unfortunately, the school didn’t last long. After only six months the Leba-\n', 'nese government destroyed the school and the four surrounding refugee camps. \n', 'This was a devastating loss for Mohamad: he felt like he had lost the underpinning \n', 'of his new life. To him it felt like a second displacement.\n', 'However, undeterred by this blow, Mohamad and his family found a creative \n', 'way to reopen the school. They rented a big house and turned it into a school. \n', 'The Lebanese owner was very sympathetic, and offered them legal protection so \n', 'they were safe to reopen.\n', 'Today Mohamad’s activism has expanded to an international stage. In \n', '2017, he and his mother and uncle moved to Sweden, where he started an NGO \n', '(non-governmental organization) called Gharsah Sweden, to support the refugee \n', 'school in Lebanon. And he is continuing to work tirelessly to preserve the educa-\n', 'tional values most important to him.\n', 'After winning the International Children’s Peace Prize, he now has more \n', 'money and resources to help the school. But Mohamad stresses the fact that \n', 'money isn’t all that is needed. “Activism can’t be focused only on raising money,” \n', 'he says. “It has to be a fight to end systemic issues. Even global issues are best \n', 'addressed when smaller communities are empowered. With enough support and \n', 'resources, local people and organizations can create the solutions that will work in \n', 'their own communities and situations.”\n', 'By building the school in a refugee camp, Mohamad and his family chal-\n', ' 202\n', 'lenged the system that creates refugees. “No one can expect refugees to start build-\n', 'ing schools out of nowhere and then just start teaching,” he says.\n', 'When Mohamad meets other young people on the frontlines of activism, \n', 'he feels encouraged and energized by their work.

Shortly thereafter, on September 20, 2019, using his social media savvy \n', 'he organized a climate strike, and he got more than 150 people to attend. His \n', 'digital organizing experience brought him to Fridays For Future Digital (FFFD), \n', 'and he began collaborating with them on a much larger scale.\n', 'At FFFD, Jett found a niche, creating and developing digital protests. \n', 'Through various social media platforms, youth activists were urged to send photos \n', 'and messages, and to create digital collages showing the extensive support network \n', 'of youth around the world. “Activism is similar to entrepreneurship, only the end \n', 'goal is impact, not money,” Jett says. And considering the near-global lockdowns \n', 'from COVID-19, his impact has been all the more extraordinary. When the quar-\n', 'antine started in March 2020, people couldn’t physically protest. “But you can still \n', 'keep these important environmental issues on the top of your mind and that sense \n', 'of community strong, with digital activism.”\n', 'Jett’s efforts have helped FFFD empower thousands of activists, many of \n', 'whom are new to the movement. He hopes that getting more youth involved in \n', 'these campaigns can further help those in isolation feel some sense of community. \n', '“I ended up creating some of the strongest relationships of my life during a time \n', 'of isolation; which goes to show us the beauty that the technology can have if it’s \n', 'used in a positive way,” he says.\n', 'Jett often leverages the FFFD platform to assist environmental groups that \n', 'have less reach and visibility, and that normally wouldn’t have access to the re-\n', 'sources or networks to help them get meaningful exposure and community sup-\n', 'port. One story that was particularly important to Jett came to light via the work \n', 'of a partner group called Defend Defenders. Defend Defenders stands up for the \n', 'human rights of environmental defenders and Indigenous people in the East and \n', 'Horn of Africa subregions. Through this group, Jett learned about Friends of \n', 'Zoka, and he decided to get FFFD virtually involved with them.\n', 'Friends of Zoka is a group of northern Ugandans who are trying to stop ille-\n', 'gal logging in the rainforests, which has destroyed roughly 60 percent of the stand-\n', 'ing rainforest of the country in the last 20 years. “I reached out to the Whatsapp \n', 'number on their website and was able to speak with William Amanzuru, who was \n', 'cataloguing evidence of the devastation,” Jett says. At the time, William was hid-\n', 'ing from the local commissioner in the Moyo District. The Whatsapp technology \n', 'not only allowed Jett to communicate with him, but helped them work together \n', 'to coordinate a digital campaign to put pressure on the Ugandan government \n', 'through tweets and emails sent from around the world. “It just goes to show you \n', 'that even a social messaging app can impact change,” Jett says. “This wasn’t some-\n', '205\n', 'thing that was possible for wildlife defenders like William 20 years ago, when the \n', 'illegal foresting began.”\n', 'Jett has also played an integral role in connecting FFFD with the Re- Earth \n', 'Initiative, and combining their expertise as leading digital activist networks to in-\n', 'fluence legislation for vulnerable groups worldwide. The focus of their most recent \n', 'joint effort is to raise awareness and support from Caribbean and Latin American \n', 'governments for the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Par-\n', 'ticipation, and Justice in Environmental Matters. This is a groundbreaking piece \n', 'of legislation for persecuted Indigenous peoples, which is better known as the \n', '#EscazúAgreement because it was first adopted in Escazú, Costa Rica.\n', 'The #EscazúAgreement is the first binding treaty in Latin America and \n', 'the Caribbean to deal with environmental democracy and environmental human \n', 'rights. In many places in these regions, the Indigenous populations are horribly \n', 'abused by powerful corporations and the rogue government officials that allow \n', 'the corporations free reign, simply for standing up for and protecting their land. \n', 'Currently, there is little legal recourse for a defender of the environment who \n', 'is being persecuted, strong-armed, bribed, physically harmed and intimidated, \n', 'or even murdered by outside interests. Ratifying this agreement would provide \n', 'the Indigenous populations who are being exploited proper access to data about \n', 'ongoing projects, and the chance to participate in the planning and conversations \n', 'around what projects will be allowed. Perhaps most importantly, it provides legal \n', 'protections for those who are persecuted while defending the natural habitats they \n', 'call home. “I’m honored to spend my time defending the most vulnerable people \n', 'in the most vulnerable places,” Jett says. “This sort of community building is \n', 'something I will always be involved in.”\n', 'Jett wants young people to understand that whatever the scope of the cause \n', 'they are interested in, or whatever your personality is, you can get involved in a \n', 'way that suits you as an individual. Many types of people coming together is what \n', 'makes the climate movement so impactful. “For example, I like to design systems \n', 'behind the scenes,” Jett says. “I like to engage in digital community building. I \n', 'play many roles for FFFD that aren’t obvious or glamorous, but they make just as \n', 'significant an impact on the cause as the outward-facing figures of the movement. \n', 'I like to say to other activists who are reserved, like me, you can’t make a movie \n', 'without the cameraman, can you?”\n', 'With up and coming leaders like Jett, who are so effective at digitally orga-\n', 'nizing youth communities, the climate justice movement has significantly expand-\n', 'ed its reach to a network of tech-savvy, motivated activists across the virtual world. \n', ' 206\n', 'This virtual approach by FFFD and youth leaders like Jett shows that no matter \n', 'what logistical problems may arise from something like a pandemic, innovative \n', 'activists will always have opportunities to use their intelligence and their creativity \n', 'to keep the momentum of their work rolling forward.\n', 'While incorporating the guidance of environmental activists before him, Jett \n', 'has set an example of digital resilience in the face of myriad obstacles, through \n', 'his efforts at organizing online protests and shining a light on stories that will no \n', 'longer go untold.

43,Adenike Oladosu,Eco-Feminism For Climate Action,207,211,"['Eco-Feminism For Climate Action\n', 'Adenike Oladosu | Nigeria\n', 'Adenike Oladosu grew up in Abuja, Nigeria, and is from Ogbomosho, \n', '207\n', 'where delicious cashews and mangos are grown on nearby plantations. From a \n', 'young age, Adenike could see that unfair agricultural practices were harming ru-\n', 'ral communities, especially for Indigenous people. So when it was time for her to \n', 'go to college, she moved to north central Nigeria to study agricultural economics \n', 'at the University of Agriculture in Makurdi.\n', 'Thus began Adenike’s journey into the environmental movement. Her \n', 'university, Benue State, was in “the food basket of Nigeria,” near Lake Chad. \n', 'While there, she was a firsthand witness to the destruction that climate change \n', 'was having on this vulnerable region of her country. Water scarcity was turning \n', 'farmland into desert. Communities that had never known floods before were \n', 'watching their lands and livelihoods disappear under torrents of water. Powerful \n', 'heat waves blasted the arid pastures, leaving nothing left to farm. As the land \n', 'grew arid and pastures disappeared, farmers and herdsmen were fighting for their \n', 'survival. Their conflict became so widespread that her classes were disrupted, and \n', 'it took her an extra year to finish her studies.\n', 'Nigeria prides itself on its natural wildlife reserves, waterfalls, dense rainfor-\n', 'est, savannas, and rare primate habitats. However climate change is ravaging this \n', 'nation. Nigeria is not alone: many African nations are desperately facing water \n', 'scarity. Without water, crops can’t grow, which leads to millions of people at risk \n', 'of malnutrition. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that \n', 'more than 815 million people are malnourished around the world. Most are in \n', 'Africa, and climate change is making this dire situation worse.\n', 'The implications are far-reaching. When conflicts arise, food becomes even \n', 'more scarce. When farmers and herdsmen lose their livelihoods, they are more \n', 'vulnerable to being recruited by terrorist groups like Boko Haram. The increasing \n', 'severity of climate change escalates violence, and in turn, strengthens the pow-\n', 'erful grip of such groups. In 2014, when Boko Haram militants kidnapped 276 \n', 'Nigerian girls from the Chibok High School, the world finally took notice.\n', 'The rise in gender-based violence is deeply troubling to Adenike. “Wherever \n', 'there are security issues arising from the environment, the women are always the \n', 'default victims,” she says. “This deters us from ever achieving gender equality.” \n', 'The kidnapping of these girls made Adenike realize that girls and women’s rights \n', 'must be at the center of the climate movement.\n', 'Adenike knew that something had to be done. And the 2018 U.N. Intergov-\n', 'ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report has confirmed her worst fears: \n', 'that report says that the world has only twelve years to take drastic measures, or \n', 'it will be too late to stop climate change. “These issues have a timeline,” she says. \n', ' 208\n', '“We are heading toward a point of no return. We need to deal with climate change \n', 'now, so that we can overcome it and be victorious.”\n', 'In 2018 Adenike joined the worldwide Fridays for Future movement started \n', 'by Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish activist. Now 25, Adenike serves as Ni-\n', 'geria’s Fridays for Future ambassador. And working with Nigeria Earth Uprising \n', 'and African Youth Climate Hub, she focuses on women’s rights, security, and \n', 'peacebuilding across Africa, especially in the Lake Chad region.\n', 'Adenike calls her own personal brand of activism “Eco-Feminism,” and \n', 'stresses that climate change solutions must prioritize the safety and well-being \n', 'of women and girls. She travels around the country, going to schools to educate \n', 'students about the effects of climate change. She works with Indigenous commu-\n', 'nities, to learn how traditional knowledge can contribute to climate resilience. She \n', 'shows people how new technologies can improve their well-being and livelihood. \n', 'She teaches them about renewable resources, and about how they can use better \n', 'sources of energy in their own communities. And she shows them how to advo-\n', 'cate for renewable energy on a larger scale. Through education, she hopes the \n', 'movement will spread. “When people know how to use alternative energy, they \n', 'can replicate these actions, and other people will learn how to use them,” she \n', 'explains. “With that, changing habits becomes more rapid, and naturally people \n', 'will switch from fossil fuels without being forced.”\n', 'For International Women’s Day in 2021, Adenike believes that environmen-\n', 'tal issues should be the core theme, so that women’s issues can be brought to the \n', 'forefront of the climate justice movement. As she has grown into her role as an \n', 'international leader in the climate movement, she’s concerned that there is too \n', 'little focus on communities in the Global South. In 2019, when she attended COP \n', '25 in Madrid, she expected that the regeneration of Lake Chad, and its innovative \n', 'climate finance programs, which are helping communities adapt to and reduce \n', 'the effects of climate change, would be spotlighted. But to her dismay, climate \n', 'change in the Lake Chad region was hardly even mentioned. “If international \n', 'representatives don’t recognize the current dangers of climate change in African \n', 'countries, there will be global repercussions,” she says. For example, the people \n', 'who are being displaced by climate change are increasingly migrating to countries \n', 'in the Global North. Many have already been forced to leave their homes and live \n', 'in refugee camps. “If Africa loses the race of climate action, it’s going to affect all \n', 'of our countries,” Adenike says, and she emphasizes, “We really need to support \n', 'Africa now.”\n', 'In Nigeria, Adenike is fighting to re-subsidize renewable energy, and find \n', '209\n', 'sources of energy that have low carbon emissions. “Every nation everywhere \n', 'needs to prioritize renewable energy,” she says. She also wants to see more unified \n', 'government action, so that climate change is treated as the crisis that it is. She was \n', 'disappointed that representatives at COP 25 failed to ratify Article 6 of the Paris \n', 'Agreement, which promotes international cooperation among nations in order to \n', 'reach their carbon emission targets. “Article 6 is essential if we are to reduce the \n', 'effects of climate change,” she says. “There must be more unified action in order \n', 'for the Paris Agreement to succeed.”\n', 'Currently Adenike’s climate activism focuses on two major fronts. First, she \n', 'is trying to engage the world’s youth, especially in African countries, and get them \n', 'to really care about climate change. “Many youth have yet to pay attention to \n', 'these issues that will define our future,” she says. Through her education outreach, \n', 'she helps the children of today to understand what is at stake. “I believe education \n', 'is a powerful weapon that we can use to conquer climate change,” she says. Plant-\n', 'ing trees is now an important part of Fridays for Future in Nigeria. As a form of \n', 'positive protest, school communities plant trees, while some of the children hold \n', 'signs that say things like “Keep It In The Ground.” And they talk about how if \n', 'they take care of the trees, they will grow into a forest for their own children.\n', 'Adenike is also the founder of “ILeadClimate,” a panAfrican movement that \n', 'is advocating for the restoration of Lake Chad for sustainable development and \n', 'disarmament. The lake, which borders Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, and Chad, and \n', 'supports about 40 million people, has shrunk by 90 percent. “Climate change is \n', 'disproportionately affecting this region,” Adenike says. “It is estimated that about \n', '10.7 million people have been displaced, and 2.7 million are food insecure.” She \n', 'adds, “The strongest weapon against peace and security is the loss of livelihoods, \n', 'because it affects food security, which leads to poverty and hunger.” In 2020, Ile-\n', 'adClimate was recognized by UNICEF Nigeria as a changemaker for their work \n', 'in the environmental movement, along with other global recognition.\n', 'According to Adenike, climate change should be the top priority for every-\n', 'one, everywhere; and the media should be amplifying climate issues and helping \n', 'to promote climate action. She wants more youth everywhere to join the climate \n', 'movement, and to participate in initiatives like Fridays for Future. To connect \n', 'with more young people, she does a lot of social media outreach. “As more youth \n', 'join this movement, it will make our leaders wake up to the reality of what is \n', 'happening,” she says. “We need both individual and collective action to combat \n', 'climate change. Everyone has to take responsibility. We don’t have to wait for \n', 'government action.” She adds, “The only way to solve climate change is to keep \n', ' 210\n', 'going, and keep demanding action.

However, she did study English, \n', 'and she knew the language well.\n', '“So, I thought maybe I could help children with learning English,” she says. \n', '“I volunteered at several children’s homes, as an English and meditation teacher.”\n', 'When she saw the overwhelming need among the children she was helping, \n', 'she mobilized others to join her. She formed a committee with other young lead-\n', 'ers to coordinate and strengthen their efforts. This was the beginning of her “In-\n', 'visible to Visible” movement, a campaign founded to address the social exclusion \n', 'of those who are marginalized. She also wrote a book about her experiences, and \n', 'what she had learned from her research into social issues, entitled Social Invisibility \n', 'Is Not a Fiction It Exists.\n', 'Michelle had often heard her elders talk about changing weather patterns \n', 'in Sri Lanka.

To be a bridge \n', 'from the old to the new. On one hand, it’s one of the hardest times for young \n', 'people to be alive. But we can also look at these times in a different light. What \n', 'a gift and a privilege it is to be the ones that get to make the leap! Young people \n', 'today have the opportunity to lead social movements and make sweeping changes \n', 'on our planet like we’ve never seen before. In that moment, I really believed, in \n', 'the depth of my soul, that we are going to make it. That was when the vision of \n', 'Generation Waking Up came into my life.”\n', 'Joshua returned home and enrolled in George Mason University, knowing \n', 'that he had to further hone his leadership skills. He had a vision, but he knew he \n', 'needed the training and education in order to fulfill it. But what he wanted to \n', 'learn was hard to find, so he created his own major – Global Youth and Social \n', 'Change. He began working, learning, volunteering, and mentoring with all types \n', 'of nonprofits, youth programs, and social justice organizations.\n', 'As he engaged in social change movements, he approached it in a holistic \n', 'way. “We don’t need environmental, political, or economic change. We needed a \n', 'systems change. A complete cultural shift in our values and structure,” he says.\n', 'In trying to answer the question of how to bring about this larger, systemic \n', ' 216\n', 'change came Joshua’s vision for Generation Waking Up. Its mission: to ignite a \n', 'generation of young people to bring forth a “thriving, just, and sustainable world.” \n', 'Its flagship workshop is called “The WakeUp Experience,” a 2-3 hour multime-\n', 'dia experience that explores four specific questions: Who are we? Where are we? \n', 'What has to change? and What do we do now?\n', '“It’s a framework and curriculum for these times,” Joshua explains. “We are \n', 'training spiritual activists and systemic change makers. There’s a lot of personal \n', 'and interpersonal leadership training involved, which is so often lacking in work-\n', 'shops and training programs. It really helps, to connect the dots between the inner \n', 'work and the outer work. This connection is essential for any individual and group \n', 'to be effective.”\n', 'Addressing these complicated social issues can be daunting. This holistic \n', 'worldview is important to Joshua because it’s precisely this understanding that \n', 'he himself lacked as a youth. “There’s this notion around urgency that I think is \n', 'incomplete. Yes, we need to be out there taking action against these big problems. \n', 'Mobilizing and spreading awareness. Because it’s true, our times are urgent times. \n', 'But sometimes we also need to take a step back. Retreat. Take some time alone \n', 'in nature. Meditate. And listen. Just listen. To the wisdom that comes from that \n', 'deeper place when we’re alone in nature. Or to a spiritual advisor or mentor. We \n', 'need to tap into that deeper well of meaning and inspiration that is necessary \n', 'in order to sustain our social change work.

Only the hummingbird decided to stay. It picked up water \n', 'from the river with its tiny beak, and began dropping it onto the raging fire below. \n', '221\n', 'All of the other animals asked, “What do you think you can do? You are too little!” \n', 'But the hummingbird replied, “I will do my little bit to help stop the fire. I will do \n', 'what I can.” And it continued fighting the fire.\n', 'Everyone in Lesein’s country of Kenya respected the great Wangari Maathai, \n', 'who shared this story with people to inspire them to join her Green Belt Move-\n', 'ment, and plant trees to restore their country’s degraded watersheds and save their \n', 'livelihoods. In 2004, the year Lesein was born, she received the Nobel Peace Prize \n', 'for her contributions to sustainable development, democracy, and peace. She is \n', 'one of Lesein’s biggest heroes.\n', 'One day, when he was 14 years old Lesein was on his way to school, sitting \n', 'in his mom’s car, when he realized something awful. He was reading about de-\n', 'forestation and air pollution in Kenya. Lesein loves going on hikes, cycling, and \n', 'camping out in the nature. But he realized that unless something was done about \n', 'these issues, soon all of this would no longer be possible.\n', '“I decided to do further research,” he says. He learned that Kenya’s forests \n', 'have suffered a lot in past decades. In 1963, when the country became indepen-\n', 'dent, 12 percent of Kenya was covered in forests. By 2015, the forest cover was \n', 'down to only 7.6 percent. “I calculated that in Kenya, we were losing ten football \n', 'pitches [of forest] every hour.”\n', 'Ten football pitches—Lesein knows very well how much that is. Because \n', 'above all, he is a passionate football player. He plays for Ligi Ndogo, a football \n', 'club in his hometown of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. And it was the combina-\n', 'tion of his passion for sports and his environmental awareness that gave him an \n', 'ingenious idea: he decided that for every goal he would score, he would plant one \n', 'tree. He would fight deforestation one tree, and one goal, at a time.\n', '“No matter how big the problem is, I just needed to make a difference,” he \n', 'says. And so, in honor of his hero Wangari Maathai, who died in 2011, Lesein \n', 'founded the organization, Trees4Goals.\n', 'Every week Lesein would go to football practice and train with his team-\n', 'mates. When he came home, he would note down how many goals he had scored \n', 'in a little book. The next week, he would buy a little tree from a roadside store; \n', 'then he would head out and plant it in a school, park, or forest.\n', '“The problem is that people are not replanting,” he explains. And the con-\n', 'sequences of this are deforestation and air pollution. “Trees take in polluted air,” \n', 'he says. “Planting trees is really important to reverse climate change.” That is why \n', 'Lesein set himself a clear goal: he wants forests to grow back to cover more than10 \n', 'percent of Kenya.\n', ' 222\n', 'For Lesein, fighting against climate change means fighting for the survival of \n', 'his community. Last year, mudslides devastated Northwestern Kenya after a rainy \n', 'season that was much heavier than usual. “There have also been droughts, and \n', 'because of that, we have less food,” he says. “So there are farmers who are in real \n', 'trouble, who aren’t able to grow their crops.”\n', 'After a while, Lesein realized that he needed to do even more. “I decided to \n', 'increase my commitment. So for every goal I score, I decided to plant ten trees.” \n', 'Soon, the people around him took note of his efforts. His teammates joined in \n', 'planting the trees. Then his school’s rugby team wanted to participate. And when \n', 'one of his friends asked if he could do the same thing, only for basketball, “I told \n', 'him of course he can!” Lesein says. So now, there is also a Hoops4Trees group, \n', 'joining with Trees4Goals in planting trees.\n', 'When a high school in South Africa invited Lesein to join forces, he began \n', 'extending his work to other African countries. “As we expand, I make sure people \n', 'learn from the experience,” he says. “And that they take home with them an ap-\n', 'preciation for why we’re they’re doing this.”\n', 'For Lesein, making sure that people understand what is at stake is an im-\n', 'portant aspect of his activism. “Many people in my generation don’t know about \n', 'what’s happening to our planet,” he says. “No one is teaching them; we’re not \n', 'taught this in school.” Too often, he says, people feel that you need to be an activ-\n', 'ist or a scientist to understand what is driving climate change. With Trees4Goals, \n', 'Lesein gets people involved and educates them at the same time. “For them to \n', 'know what’s behind deforestation and pollution, and how we can reduce it by \n', 'planting trees, that really keeps them interested,” he says.\n', 'Lesein is keen on getting as many people as possible to talk about the topic, \n', 'and take action. Last year, together with his football club, he planted 600 trees \n', 'in the Karura Forest, a park in Nairobi. In Ngong Forest he planted another 350 \n', 'trees, together with his schoolmates. “We would finish one tree and move on to the \n', 'next,” he says. “When we really got the hang of it, it was fun.”\n', 'Lesein feels that football, which is the most popular sport in the world, is a \n', 'great way to educate people. “There are so many famous footballers who have \n', 'a powerful influence on people,” he said. “With their large stadium audiences, \n', 'they can influence thousands of others to go out and learn more about the prob-\n', 'lems, and create a very, very big awareness.” He has an ambitious goal to take his \n', 'Trees4Goals campaign to the next level: he wants to get FIFA, the International \n', 'Federation of Association Football, on board. “If this happens, there’ll really be a \n', 'big difference on the topic of climate change,” he says. “There’ll be a large num-\n', '223\n', 'ber of people that will then know about environmental conservation. It would be \n', 'amazing!”\n', 'Over the last few years, Lesein has become an emblem of environmental \n', 'activism in Kenya.

Slowly, the locals had added their trash, creating a landfill right in \n', 'the middle of Aadya’s neighborhood. The cars were stacked on top of each other, \n', 'some decades old, and the stench of the trash between the car wrecks would drift \n', 'through the streets in the hot summer months.\n', '“For a long time, my friends and I tried to figure out why no one was doing \n', 'anything about it,” says Aadya. “So in the end I went to the police commissioner \n', 'and the inspector and I said okay, I can make a garden in this garbage dump if it’s \n', 'not being used productively.”\n', 'It took another month of convincing, but ultimately the police agreed. \n', 'Aadya got some friends and local residents together, and for a month they met \n', 'every weekend, cleaned out the trash, removed the contaminated soil, replaced \n', 'it, and moved the old cars. They even cut up some of the cars, turning them into \n', 'pots for some of the plants. Then they spent another weekend planting the garden \n', '225\n', 'in the old garbage dump. “It turned into a community project,” says Aadya. “This \n', 'garbage dump had been an issue in our community for a while.”\n', 'For Aadya, this urban gardening project was the spark that lit a fire. She saw \n', 'the power of one community garden, so she wanted to create even more. Then, \n', 'at a workshop on gardens she was inspired to become the environmental activist \n', 'she is today. “Their philosophy was to plant a lot of native trees to create an urban \n', 'forest,” Aadya explains.\n', 'Aadya had learned about native and nonnative plants in biology class. How-\n', 'ever, she had never realized how important native plant species were to the plan-\n', 'et’s ecosystems, even in a big city like Mumbai. “What I learned in the workshop, \n', 'I thought that’s actually really smart,” she says. “You plant things that are native \n', 'because they provide more ecological stability.”\n', 'Aadya embarked on a discovery process that led to the research of Dr. Doug \n', 'Tallamy, a professor in the Department of Entomology and Wildlife Ecology at \n', 'the University of Delaware. From him she learned how important native plants \n', 'were for supporting local insects, which in turn were an important source of food \n', 'for local bird species.\n', 'This reminded her of the stories her grandfather had told her about the \n', 'Mumbai of his childhood. He had described trips with his family, where they \n', 'would see leopards, and colorful birds in the trees. It was a very different Mumbai \n', 'from the one that Aadya knows, polluted and smelly; the only birds she ever saw \n', 'were pigeons and crows.\n', 'Suddenly Aadya understood why there were no more colorful birds in the \n', 'trees of Mumbai: they were the wrong trees! The problem in India goes back to \n', 'colonial times, Aadya explains. The British brought with them many types of trees \n', 'that weren’t native to the region, and they were slowly adopted by local people. \n', 'But because these trees weren’t from India, the local insect and bird populations \n', 'couldn’t feed off of them or adapt quickly enough.\n', '“In India, but especially in Mumbai, you see a lot of these colonial, nonna-\n', 'tive invasive plants,” Aadya says. “For example, rain trees. People say they’ve been \n', 'here for so long, they must be a vital part of our ecosystem.”\n', 'But actually, rain trees are from Costa Rica, and so is the wildlife they sup-\n', 'port. Those species that can live on the rain tree simply don’t exist in Mumbai.\n', '“If you plant native plants, then the insects come back, the butterflies come \n', 'back, you have caterpillars, and with them the birds come back,” Aadya explains. \n', 'When she read the work of Dr. Tallamy it was like a switch was turned inside her \n', ' 226\n', 'head.\n', '“I realized that maybe planting gardens was not the right thing to do,” she \n', 'says. “But if I could teach people what we should be planting and why, that would \n', 'be a much more valuable lesson.”\n', 'So Aadya launched her new plan, and sprang into action. In a local nature \n', 'park, she started offering workshops for children ages five to twelve. It was late \n', '2019, and the beginning of her organization, The Right Green.\n', 'She tested out her workshop ideas on her little brother, and her aim was \n', 'simple: teach children about the importance of native plants for local ecosystems, \n', 'and make sure they have fun at the same time.\n', '“The first part of the workshop gets them into nature, since we have a lack \n', 'of open spaces here,” she says. “And the second thing is that I try to teach them \n', 'how native plants support insects and biodiversity, and how nonnative plants don’t \n', 'support it.”\n', 'Aadya makes sure that her students have fun: she takes them around the park \n', 'and lets them find trees based on different clues. When they find the trees, she asks, \n', '“What kind of tree is this? Did you notice more insects on this tree versus another? \n', 'What differences do you see?”\n', '“I get them thinking about why it is that this mango tree has so many insects, \n', 'butterflies, and birds living in it, while something like a rain tree has maybe one \n', 'bird resting on it, but not even nesting within it.”\n', 'Aadya is happy that these workshops are having a positive impact: children \n', 'are sharing their new awareness with their families while they plant their gardens \n', 'at home. And adults are reaching out to her for advice about what plants they \n', 'should put in their gardens.\n', 'This need for advice gave Aadya her next idea. She created a database of \n', 'native plants and ranked them by the amount of biodiversity they supported. Dr. \n', 'Tallamy had accumulated this kind of data for the United States, so Aadya got \n', 'in touch with him to learn more about his methods. What she learned from him \n', 'she used to produce a dataset on native plants in India. “What I want to create is \n', 'a resource that a lot of people can use so that when they plant their gardens, they \n', 'will seed well,” she says.\n', 'Aadya’s innovation has brought praise and support. She was awarded fund-\n', 'ing by The Pollination Project, an international organization that funds projects \n', 'aimed at social change. With the money she received, Aadya printed booklets to \n', 'give people in her workshops. She also produced a short animated video for social \n', '227\n', 'media that explains the importance of planting not just any trees, but the right \n', 'ones—the “right green.”\n', 'With climate change causing ever more extreme weather in India, the need \n', 'for planting native trees only becomes more urgent, Aadya says. Native trees are \n', 'more resilient and can adapt more easily to changing conditions than nonnative \n', 'trees. And having a healthy population of plants is indispensable for the sustain-\n', 'ability of ecosystems anywhere.\n', '“The whole point about planting native is to reduce the damage that climate \n', 'change has done,” says Aadya. “There is this relationship between the plants, the \n', 'insects, and the birds, and then the rest of the food chain, to help repair some of \n', 'the damage.”\n', 'With her workshop and her database, Aadya is educating both future gener-\n', 'ations and those making seemingly small decisions today, like what plants to put in \n', 'their garden, that can have a big impact. “If we don’t make a conscious effort to \n', 'change, and to make the world someplace that we want to live in, then we’re really \n', 'not doing our duty as current and future leaders,” she says.\n', '“It’s like my dad and my grandfather always told me, if you want something \n', 'to happen, you have to do it yourself.

49,Cruz Erdmann,Seeing The Ocean In A New Way,229,233,"['Seeing The Ocean In A New Way\n', 'Cruz Erdmann | New Zealand\n', 'For Cruz, being underwater feels like being in space. He feels weightless. He \n', 'can dive in any direction and gaze at his surroundings. “It’s like a dream,” he says. \n', '“Swimming through an ocean is like visiting another planet.”\n', 'At first, the infinite seascape might seem empty. But it is really full of life. \n', 'There is plankton flowing through the water. If you listen closely, sometimes you \n', 'can hear dolphins clicking in the distance, or parrot fish crunching coral. And you \n', 'can see reefs that are teeming with life: fish of all colors and shapes.\n', 'The ocean has been a part of Cruz’s life since he was born. His parents met \n', 'in South Sulawesi, Indonesia when his father, a marine biologist, was working on \n', 'his PhD, and his mother was traveling through Asia. Later she became his father’s \n', 'field assistant, and then a marine conservationist working with local communities \n', 'to help them protect their natural resources. “Living in Bali, there is always the \n', 'ocean that you go to,” Cruz says of his first eight years of life. “I just have been \n', 'immersed in that since I was born.”\n', 'Cruz’s family would spend their holidays in nature, traveling around Asia \n', 'and going on diving trips. Sometimes he would accompany his father on expedi-\n', 'tions, searching for unknown species in the depth of the oceans. There he would \n', 'be his father’s field assistant, holding jars and syringes for him while he document-\n', 'ed the underwater wildlife.\n', 'When Cruz was 10, his father decided that he would invest in a new under-\n', 'water camera for his work. So, after a long lecture on the value of the equipment, \n', 'Cruz got to try his hand at underwater photography for the first time, using his \n', 'father’s old camera. His father gave him a quick explanation of what the different \n', 'dials on the camera would do, but from there on out it was all about experiment-\n', 'ing with different perspectives, and trying to capture various species underwater. \n', '“It wasn’t something I really thought of taking to a high level,” he says. “It was \n', '229\n', 'just for fun.”\n', 'Then one day, on a diving trip in the Lembeh Strait off North Sulawesi, \n', 'Indonesia, camera in hand, he had an unexpected encounter with a Bigfin Reef \n', 'Squid. Cruz raised his camera and pressed the shutter. In the photo, the animal \n', 'hovers in the pitch black, glowing in different shades of blue, green, brown, and \n', 'red, its tentacles stretched out in front of it. It won Cruz the Young Wildlife Pho-\n', 'tographer of the Year Award, organized by London’s Natural History Museum. \n', '“Winning that award was a real opportunity to get a footing,” he says. “I’ve always \n', 'wanted to do something that revolved around media, or art, or science, around \n', 'the oceans.”\n', 'Receiving the award opened up more doors for 14-year-old Cruz: he was \n', 'invited to speak at the Davos Forum in Switzerland, the yearly meeting of leading \n', 'economic decision makers, dignitaries, celebrities, and heads of state. He was \n', 'thrilled to meet Dr. Sylvia Earle, a marine biologist he greatly admires, who spoke \n', 'there, and said, “I wish you would use all means at your disposal—films, expedi-\n', 'tions, the web, new submarines—to create a campaign to ignite public support for \n', 'a global network of marine protected areas—‘hope spots’ large enough to save \n', 'and restore the blue heart of the planet.” And as he began his presentation, Cruz \n', 'said, “We blink 15 to 20 times a minute. Why? We blink because our eyes haven’t \n', 'yet fully adapted to seeing outside of water.”\n', '“Life on our planet is shaped by the oceans,” Cruz says. Ocean currents \n', 'regulate the earth’s temperature. Plankton and other ocean plant species produce \n', 'more than 60 percent of all of the oxygen found in our atmosphere. But human \n', 'activity is destroying biodiversity and the intricate ecosystems that support life un-\n', 'derwater. “It’s a great natural resource,” Cruz says. “But it’s become expendable, \n', 'and we’ve been pushing it to the brink.”\n', 'Growing up in Indonesia, Cruz was able to witness the importance of \n', 'marine life and coral reefs for local communities. “Coral reefs are fish factories,” \n', 'Cruz said, on the stage at Davos. “They produce a large amount of fish mass that \n', 'spills into the surrounding ecosystems, linking it with the food chain that extends \n', 'into the open ocean.”\n', 'Oceans provide a livelihood to people where crops simply can’t grow, and \n', 'other natural resources aren’t available. Ecosystems like coral reefs support coastal \n', 'populations as well as all the other life in the ocean. But climate change is causing \n', 'them to bleach and die off more than in the past. “Most instances of bleaching \n', 'occur during El Nino warming events,” Cruz says. “And those are now more in-\n', 'tense, and more common, with climate change.” During diving trips in Indonesia \n', ' 230\n', 'and the Maldives, as well as in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, Cruz \n', 'has noticed that some coral reefs are more resilient to changing temperatures than \n', 'others. But he adds, “Most of them are suffering badly around the world.”\n', 'Cruz explains that the invention of trawl nets and large-scale fishing has \n', 'led to a new level of consumerism that is simply not sustainable. “For a long time, \n', 'there was an assumption that we could just fish as much as we wanted, without \n', 'decimating populations. But we can’t.”\n', 'The main problem, as Cruz argued on the stage at Davos, is that we have \n', 'become so disconnected from the oceans. We buy our food from the shelves of \n', 'supermarkets, without thinking twice about where it came from. This means that \n', 'most people are unaware of the negative effects their decisions as consumers have \n', 'on the environment–effects that include overfishing, pollution, and habitat de-\n', 'struction. “We’ve basically grown used to it as consumers of the ocean,” he says. \n', '“And it hasn’t really stopped, even though we know that it is having a very negative \n', 'impact.”\n', 'Another threat caused by climate change is ocean acidification. This hap-\n', 'pens when the oceans have to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere \n', 'than usual. That changes the chemical balance of sea water, and many organisms \n', 'can no longer grow properly. Oysters, mussels, and plankton can even be dissolved \n', 'if the water is too acidic.\n', '“If the foundations of our ocean food chains are not able to grow their shells, \n', 'the consequences will be disastrous,” Cruz says. “It’s a serious issue, with real \n', 'consequences that affect every single one of us, no matter how far from the ocean \n', 'we live.”\n', 'Cruz wants to change the way we look at the ocean. By sharing powerful \n', 'photographic images, he wants to give the creatures living underwater a face—\n', 'and help us to see that our current way of life is unsustainable.\n', 'As an underwater photographer, Cruz feels it is his responsibility to bridge \n', 'the gap between humans and the ocean. “I want to captivate people’s attention \n', 'about a world they may never have seen before,” he says. “And allow us to develop \n', 'a better appreciation for our dependence on the ocean.” He is particularly inter-\n', 'ested in macro photography, in which the objects photographed are very close \n', 'to the lens. “It’s like exploring a hidden world through much sharper eyes than \n', 'my own,” he says. Many people don’t really think of fish as animals. It’s hard to \n', 'imagine that they can feel pain, and even harder to have an affinity for them. But \n', 'fish—especially the tiny fish that Cruz likes to take pictures of—are the “rice of \n', 'the reef.” “Without them, the coral reef ecosystem would crumble and starve,” he \n', '231\n', 'says. “They are the staple base food; they keep the coral reef ecosystems going.”\n', 'On a recent dive in the Maldives, Cruz was overcome with a feeling of awe. \n', 'He was surrounded by marine wildlife. Around him, the entire ocean was filled \n', 'with sharks, and fish, and rays. Animals that he rarely saw in Indonesia were \n', 'found by the dozens in a single dive.\n', '“I’ve heard stories about how the ocean used to be so full and rich, and so \n', 'thick with life,” he says. “It didn’t really hit home until I saw that dive site—this \n', 'what it is supposed to be! The clicking and crackling of creatures on the reef, and \n', 'the sound of fishes rushing by, was deafening.”\n', '“If you genuinely love or believe in something and you want to do something \n', 'about it, no matter how insignificant you may feel about it, you should do it,” he \n', 'says. “Because if you do what you love, and you fight for what you believe in, then \n', 'ultimately, you’re going to get there.”\n', 'Protect the natural systems as if your life depends on it, \n', 'because it does! \n', 'Our lives do depend on making peace with nature.\n', 'Sylvia Earle\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Natural beauty and life is all around us!

She spent time with Indigenous leaders whose families had lived \n', 'in the country’s interior for centuries. They taught her the basics of living off the \n', 'grid, and emphasized the importance of being in tune with the sacred water of \n', 'the river.

Or even how to steer a canoe!” she says. “That’s when \n', 'it struck me that for the Indigenous people, the river is much more than a food \n', '233\n', 'source; it’s also their cultural heritage, transportation, and recreation.”\n', 'Having studied environmental science in college, she did know, however, \n', 'that the waters of that sacred river were being polluted by mercury. And two \n', 'weeks in the interior forced her to reckon with what might happen to Guyana’s \n', 'Indigenous population if the pollution of the river continues. “They have no other \n', 'means of survival,” she says.\n', 'As a child, Benita had always been drawn to the natural world. Growing up \n', 'in a city and attending school in the capital, Georgetown, she didn’t have many \n', 'opportunities to learn about environmental issues. But she did what she could.

The first is to help the people of interested coun-\n', 'tries meet their need for training men and women, and this always comes from \n', 'the host country. For example, Malawi had expressed a need for more English \n', 'teachers, so that’s why I was sent there.” The other two goals are about promoting \n', 'better understanding among Americans toward the rest of the world, and of other \n', 'people toward Americans.\n', 'Along with her fellow teachers, Jill lived in a row of houses made with bricks \n', 'that were formed from the dirt and clay underfoot. She taught English classes \n', 'in Malawi in their developing community day schools. These secondary schools \n', 'were built by, for, and in the community, with locally sourced material—and as-\n', 'tounding ingenuity. “Early on I was told that I could farm the land in front of \n', 'and behind my house, which I hadn’t thought about doing. I was there to teach \n', 'English, after all.”\n', 'Soon other teachers noticed her empty plot, and asked Jill if they could \n', 'use her untended land.

Jill enjoyed watching them tend the land expertly; and she observed their \n', 'intimate knowledge of the land, a knowledge she hoped to have one day.\n', 'According to the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) Vul-\n', 'nerability and Adaptation Assessment Report, Malawi is subject to a unique com-\n', 'bination of climate change issues and extreme weather events like intense rainfall, \n', 'regional floods, seasonal and multiyear droughts, dry and cold spells, strong winds, \n', 'landslides, sustained thunderstorms, hailstorms, mudslides and heat waves.\n', 'When a nation’s environment is suffering, its people suffer too.

As an English teacher in the making, Jill taught \n', ' 238\n', 'the standard curriculum. But she always felt that she could inspire them in a \n', 'more profound way with a bit of creativity. “One thing I’d do is take their writing \n', 'assignments, mail them back to America for my mom to type up, then bind these \n', 'pages in spiral notebooks and send them back to Malawi, so I could show my kids \n', 'what their words looked like ‘published’ in a book. It really gave them a lot of \n', 'confidence.”\n', 'Jill also inspired her community outside of the classroom. She created com-\n', 'petitive clubs for games like Scrabble – which led to a natural exchange of cultures, \n', 'when her friends taught her the traditional Malawian game of Bawo. “I definitely \n', 'didn’t get any favors or special treatment learning to play Bawo,” she says with \n', 'a laugh. She even started a girls’ soccer team, hoping to further empower young \n', 'women in the community. “I was nominated as a coach, and we ended up orga-\n', 'nizing a girls soccer game with a neighboring village.” When one of the members \n', 'of the local parliament showed up at the game and seemed to be scowling, Jill \n', 'thought she might be upset because the girls were wearing pants instead of their \n', 'usual dresses.

For Shilpa, this manifests powerfully not only \n', 'with people, but with “how I feel toward the trees, the birds, the small insects... \n', 'that sense that we are all connected.” The third principle is aparigraha, which is \n', 'living with a sense of enough. This principle focuses on sharing and completeness, \n', 'as a means to restore balance and achieve justice and fairness.\n', 'Shilpa has integrated all of these principles into her practice of activism \n', '– from awareness, to service, to advocacy, to teaching, to the creation of develop-\n', 'ment policy, to cocreating learning communities. This journey has taken her from \n', 'Chicago to the East Coast of the U.S., to India, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Iran, \n', 'Pakistan, Senegal, Malaysia, Thailand, Bolivia, Mexico—and back to the United \n', 'States, where she now roots herself in Berkeley, California.\n', 'For the last nine years, Shilpa has been the executive director of the nonprof-\n', 'it YES! Founded in 1990 by Ocean Robbins and Ryan Eliason, YES!’s mission is \n', 'to connect, inspire, and collaborate with changemakers to build thriving, just, and \n', 'regenerative paths of life for all. For Shilpa, the military-industrial-institutional \n', 'model has stranded many people, keeping them from “the lifeboat of living in \n', 'community.” This disconnection isolates and socializes us in ways that can lead to \n', 'violence and dehumanization. Instead, Shilpa has embraced a core YES! value: \n', 'that personal, interpersonal, and systemic change are all interconnected. “We \n', 'welcome different sectors of communities that have been disaffected...and try to \n', 'move the needle in a positive direction. Together we recognize that our cultures \n', 'and identities can transform as we transform ourselves.”\n', '241\n', 'Shilpa began her journey by serving the elderly and poor. Soon, she realized \n', 'that charity and service work did not address the larger systemic issues that are \n', 'generated by failed political and economic institutions. She tried advocacy and \n', 'activism through petitions and protests and struggled with asking those who were \n', 'causing the problems to fix them, when they didn’t seem to have an incentive to \n', 'change. She experienced a similar revelation while teaching peace-making and \n', 'creative self- expression programs for at-risk youth. “These activities could only \n', 'serve as a band-aid for the attack on young peoples’ souls from the violence and \n', 'intensity of the school system and the larger world,” she says.\n', 'At the height of her frustration with trying to fix a broken world, in 1999, \n', 'Shilpa attended a conference on Gandhian education in New Delhi. There, she \n', 'met a Tibetan monk, Samdhong Rimpoche, who later became the prime minister \n', 'of the Tibetan government-in-exile, and asked him, “Don’t you think we need \n', 'to just destroy this system? It’s so violent, oppressive, and exploitative. I can’t see \n', 'a way forward without breaking it all down.” He responded, “Shilpa, instead of \n', 'thinking about destruction, think about renunciation. If you let go of the system, \n', 'if you organize around freedom and possibility and building the world we want, \n', 'the system will lose its power and you will regain yours.”\n', 'This revelation shifted Shilpa’s work as a “learning activist” at Shikshan-\n', 'tar: The Peoples’ Institute for Rethinking Education and Development, based \n', 'in Udaipur, India. She worked with Shikshantar’s cofounder and Shilpa’s elder \n', 'brother, Manish, and they were a powerful team for more than 10 years. It was \n', 'at Shikshantar that Shilpa was first able to see her way toward an integrated life, \n', '“where living is learning, and learning is living.” Through the work of Rabindranath Tag-\n', 'ore, known as “the Bard of India,” she studied creativity as a core aspect of self, \n', 'and collective, liberation. Shilpa integrated this learning by leading workshops \n', 'for children using theatre, art, and cooperative games as forms of self-expression, \n', 'collective communication, and vision development.\n', '“I had the chance to investigate and understand real-world crises and con-\n', 'flicts, from struggles against the building of big dams to the death of the small \n', 'farmer,” Shilpa explains. “I also was blessed to meet extraordinary people who, \n', 'maybe by others’ standards, might be called just ordinary. But in them, from them, \n', 'I saw wisdom, dedication, and firm belief in the true and good.”\n', 'Then, in 2002, Shilpa attended her first YES! Jam. She was drawn into the \n', 'World Youth Leadership Jam because its core principles aligned with her ideas of \n', 'co-learning - where everyone would be learning together during this week-long \n', 'intensive experience. Inspired by the way that musicians gather, the Jam is the \n', ' 242\n', 'heart and soul of YES!’s work. By design, the Jams offer an improvisational, fluid, \n', 'creative, and collaborative paradigm of human community. Over the last 20 years, \n', 'over 150+ YES! Jams have been held with changemakers on six continents. Each \n', 'of them touches on different issues and creates a shared place for an integrated \n', 'learning community.\n', '“The Jam community is an ever-expanding network with a worldwide reach, \n', 'a cauldron of human potential,” Shilpa explains. “People bring their unique \n', 'tools and talents to share and grow together. Jam leaders and attendees reflect \n', 'a kaleidoscope of diversity in origin, religion, vocation, and culture. There are \n', 'Sufis, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, Jains, Jews, those without a specific faith, \n', 'and more. Jams bring together artists, activists, educators, lawyers, dreamers, vi-\n', 'sionaries, healers, academics, data analysts, and small business owners, and so \n', 'many more people who are part of other movements and organizations. We come \n', 'together to learn from each other, to face our fears and challenges, to uncover \n', 'solutions and ways forward, to dream of a more truthful, loving, whole world – \n', 'and to practice ways to get there.”\n', 'Shilpa recalls one of the most memorable moments she had, at the sec-\n', 'ond-ever Jam in Turkey: “At the end of an incredible night of gifts and offerings \n', 'from the community – dances, songs, poems, ‘angel walks’ – a transcendent feel-\n', 'ing, something beyond me, entered the space. The group formed a circle and \n', 'started singing beautiful songs of friendship and love, and, all of a sudden the sky \n', 'was full of shooting stars. Then Aysegul, one of the cofounders of the Jam said, \n', 'with tears streaming down her face, ‘It’s possible. The world that we dream of. It’s \n', 'possible. It’s here.’ I felt that Rumi had entered the circle, and I truly felt what it \n', 'is to accept each other with all of our struggles, imperfections, beauty, and grace.”\n', 'Shilpa remembers this moment often. It inspires her to continue expanding \n', 'this powerful community, especially during these times. She knows that the more \n', 'we can listen to our inner truths and to each other, the more we can slow down \n', 'and work through our conflicts, the more we can uncover and manifest all the \n', 'solutions we need—which are already here. She hopes the next Jam will transform \n', 'more people’s lives, giving them the courage to join in cocreating a world that \n', 'works for all.\n', 'Develop enough courage so that you can stand up for yourself\n', 'and then stand up for somebody else.\n', 'Maya Angelou\n', '243\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Support YES! or sign up for a JAM. \n', 'Visit www. yesworld.org.\n', 'Follow YES!

That’s \n', 'weird: if people don’t really want a straw, it’s just a waste.”\n', 'Jasper had been aware of plastic pollution in the oceans, and how harmful \n', 'it is to marine wildlife, for some time. “Plastics wash up on our beaches, and kill \n', 'our seagulls, dolphins, and even whales,” he says. It’s been predicted that by 2050, \n', 'the oceans will actually contain more plastic than fish. When he was in elementary \n', 'school, Jasper organized beach cleanups, and posted pictures of himself on social \n', 'media, to motivate others to join him.\n', 'Jasper’s home community prides itself on its commitment to its many sus-\n', 'tainability initiatives. A picturesque island off the southern coast of Massachusetts, \n', 'Martha’s Vineyard is known as a beautiful vacation spot. Celebrities appreciate its \n', 'low-key lifestyle. Presidents and other dignitaries treasure its quiet respite from the \n', 'pressures of world affairs. During the summer, the year-round island population \n', 'of 20,000 swells to more than 100,000. And almost everyone there is concerned \n', 'about the rising sea levels, and its effect on the island. In the winter, and at high \n', 'tide, major roads are washed out. Waterfront homes have been moved back onto \n', 'land; after one big storm one home even fell off a cliff. “Sea levels are rising faster \n', ' 244\n', 'here than in other places,” Jasper says. “When climate change happens, islands \n', 'are the most affected.”\n', 'Jasper decided he wanted to do something about this problem. He knew that \n', 'his local community was passionate about sustainability. Jasper hoped that if he \n', 'shared his passion and vision with others, they would join him.\n', 'So, he joined his fellow students from the West Tisbury School to start the \n', '“Straw Free MV” initiative, and encourage people to stop using plastic straws. The \n', 'students started by visiting restaurants and take-out counters around the island: \n', 'they would boldly walk in and introduce themselves to the staff. “Hi, we are Straw \n', 'Free MV. We’re a group of kids on the island,” they would say. “We are concerned \n', 'about plastic straws. They’re wasteful, and they’re harmful to the environment. \n', 'We’d like to ask you to give straws only to those customers who ask for them, or \n', 'to not use them at all.”\n', 'Jasper and his friends created “Straw Free MV” stickers to give to the restau-\n', 'rants that agreed to join in this effort. Restaurant owners proudly displayed them, \n', 'and began giving out straws only to the customers who specifically asked for them. \n', 'The students also created educational postcards that restaurant owners could \n', 'place on their tables. And they suggested alternatives to plastic straws, like paper \n', 'straws, or reusable straws that people could carry with them. Jasper carries his \n', 'own stainless-steel straw in his backpack, and he keeps another one in his mom’s \n', 'car.\n', 'Sometimes the students’ reputation would precede them. One day they \n', 'visited the Black Dog Café, a popular restaurant located right next to the ferry \n', 'in Vineyard Haven. “We assumed that since it was such a big restaurant, they \n', 'wouldn’t want to help us,” Jasper says. But when they arrived there, the manager \n', 'was excited to see them: “Oh, great, Straw Free MV, we’ve been waiting for you!” \n', 'she said. She took all of their postcards, put them out on the tables; and asked \n', 'for more.\n', 'While reducing the use of plastic straws was an important first step, Jasper \n', 'knew there were other wasteful practices, like single-use plastic bottles of water \n', 'and soda, that needed to be addressed. With such a large tourist population, these \n', 'plastic bottles were everywhere on the island—strewn along the beaches, and fill-\n', 'ing up the recycling bins and landfills. “Plastic doesn’t just go away,” Jasper says. \n', '“Almost everything else breaks down and decomposes. But if you have a plastic \n', 'bottle that you use for just two seconds, it will be in the world for thousands of \n', 'years.”\n', 'So Jasper and his fellow youth activists set themselves a new goal. They \n', '245\n', 'developed a plan to introduce a bylaw that would forbid the selling of single-use \n', 'plastic bottles that held less than 34 ounces. They called their new group Plastic \n', 'Free MV, and they campaigned tirelessly for their cause.\n', 'To gain a broad base of support and build a strong grassroots movement, \n', 'they organized educational forums at the local libraries. They would put up post-\n', 'ers, set up chairs, and then share what they had learned through their research \n', 'with the audience. In their PowerPoint presentations, they gave a brief overview \n', 'of current climate science, and discussed how plastic production is accelerating \n', 'the climate crisis. “We are producing more than 300 million tons of plastic each \n', 'year, 50% of which is for single-use products,” reads one slide. “We can do better!” \n', 'says the next. After their presentations, they would open the forum up to debate. \n', '“We take time to answer people’s questions,” says Jasper. “It’s important to listen \n', 'to people’s opinions,” he adds. “The only way anything is achieved is by working \n', 'together.”\n', '“Sometimes people who come to the forums yell at us. They want their sin-\n', 'gle-use bottles! They want their convenience,” Jasper says. “We explain that it’s \n', 'really not about just one person—it’s about the whole world, and we all need to \n', 'help, because this is a major global issue.”\n', 'The next step for Jasper and his young changemakers was to present to the \n', 'selectmen and concerned citizens at the island’s town meetings, urging them to \n', 'adopt the new bylaw. So far three of the six towns have done so.\n', 'This work is not always easy, and not everyone is happy about the new rules. \n', '“Some businesses don’t really like the bylaw,” Jasper says. “If you are a store owner \n', 'or a distributor you can’t sell single-use plastic bottles under 34 oz. Some shops \n', 'would like to keep the plastic bottles; it’s been hard to get them on board.”\n', 'As these youth activists have learned, in the political world, it’s always \n', 'important to be on high alert. For more than a year, they’d been speaking at \n', 'selectmen meetings, carefully presenting their ideas, and respectively encouraging \n', 'dialogue about this issue. But then, when the time came to create the warrant for \n', 'the town meeting of Tisbury, the Board of Selectmen simply decided to take it off \n', 'the agenda. “One of our parents saw on Twitter that this happened,” says Jasper. \n', '“They ran right over to the meeting, and said, ‘Stop! You can’t do that!’” It took \n', 'three days of bickering, but eventually the bylaw was put back on the agenda for \n', 'the town meeting - to be held on June 13, 2020.\n', 'Jasper’s activism has now grown beyond Martha’s Vineyard. As a young \n', 'environmentalist, he knows how important it is to strengthen one’s network and \n', 'get in touch with other activists. So in September 2019, inspired by Greta Thun-\n', ' 246\n', 'berg’s speech about the urgency of addressing climate change, he and a couple of \n', 'friends went to New York City to join the climate strike.\n', 'For Jasper, seeing so many others marching together for the climate and tak-\n', 'ing steps—even little ones—to protect the environment is really important. “We \n', 'made signs with a little polar bear on it, and then we marched along with everyone \n', 'else,” Jasper says. “It was really inspiring to see that everyone cared enough to \n', 'come down there, just to march for climate action.”\n', 'Jasper believes that children all over the world should be more aware of the \n', 'power and influence they have. “We really do have the power to change what is \n', 'happening,” Jasper says. “Adults listen to us: if it was just a bunch of adults saying \n', 'we should have this bylaw, it might not have been passed. But when they see that \n', 'kids are standing up for something, it makes it look like it’s really important.”\n', 'Jasper is convinced that his activism, and that of his friends, can have a \n', 'large impact. He hopes that the changes made on Martha’s Vineyard will inspire \n', 'tourists to introduce sustainable practices in their own communities. “Maybe if \n', 'they see what we’re doing, they’ll go back to where they live, and they’ll say, ‘Hey, \n', 'why don’t we do something like that?’” Jasper says. “So, it can just spread.”\n', 'Young people, when informed and empowered, \n', 'when they realize that what they do truly makes a difference, \n', 'can indeed change the world.\n', 'Jane Goodall\n', 'Call to Action\n', ' Adopt sustainable practices in your life: Bring your own straw.

As is the case \n', 'in many modern families, Ana Sophia split her time between her parents’ homes: \n', 'her mother’s home in Miami, and her father’s in Guatemala. Her experiences in \n', 'each place were very different: and often this led to inner turmoil.\n', 'Guatemala is rich in natural beauty and culture, and Ana Sophia spent her \n', 'time there immersed in nature. On any given day, she could be found hiking \n', 'active volcanoes, playing on black sand beaches, or splashing around in the many \n', 'cascading tidal pools. There she developed a sense of wonder and adventure, as \n', 'well as a love of being outside. But for all its natural splendor, Ana Sophia came \n', 'to understand that Guatemala is a poor country. Poverty and economic inequity \n', 'are persistent problems. And there are other challenges to consider - high rates of \n', 'malnourishment, issues of Indigenous and women’s rights.\n', 'Her life in metropolitan Miami was very different: there she went to \n', 'well-funded public schools, received a great education, and could spend time \n', 'hanging out with friends without worrying about her safety. “I was conflicted \n', 'about all these differences between my two homes,” she says. It made her sad to \n', 'realize that not everybody had the opportunities she had. One day, she decided \n', 'that it was her mission to help more children have access to the educational and \n', 'socioeconomic experiences she had. But she was still just a high school student \n', 'herself, and she didn’t know yet how she could do that.\n', 'As a budding environmentalist, she knew that Miami and Guatemala are \n', 'both uniquely vulnerable to climate change. Situated as it is between two coast-\n', 'lines, Guatemala is geographically vulnerable. And its economy is dependent on \n', 'agriculture, so it’s also vulnerable to droughts and rains. Miami is also on the front \n', 'lines of climate change. At high tide in Miami Beach, the streets are flooded, even \n', '253\n', 'without hurricanes.\n', 'When Ana Sophia was a freshman in high school, she enrolled in a class \n', 'taught by Dr. Wafa Khalil, which was the only solar energy course taught in pub-\n', 'lic school in the United States at the time.

And as an \n', 'aspiring engineer she was overjoyed to learn that innovative technologies could \n', 'help impoverished areas improve economically, while also safeguarding the en-\n', 'vironment. This is when Ana Sophia’s two worlds became one. “Once I realized \n', 'I can care about the environment, and address the economic health of commu-\n', 'nities in need at the same time, I had a renewed sense of hope. I knew I’d found \n', 'my calling.”\n', 'So she set about learning everything she could about renewable energy \n', 'technology. She attended local workshops given by NGOs and climate change \n', 'organizations, and she even took a course on solar energy installation. “I even \n', 'learned how to install a solar array on a rooftop,” she says with a laugh. Even \n', 'more impressive, she achieved her B.S. in Environmental Systems Engineering \n', 'from Stanford University. “I always wanted to be an engineer, because to me, an \n', 'engineer is a problem solver.

After college, she began working at the Rocky Mountain \n', 'Institute (RMI), where she was introduced to the concept of applied hope – a \n', 'mantra which she had unwittingly been living, and aspiring toward all her life, \n', 'well before she had heard of it. Amory Lovins, RMI’s co-founder, describes the \n', 'concept of applied hope this way:\n', 'We work to make the world better, not from some airy theoretical \n', 'hope, but in the pragmatic and grounded conviction that starting \n', 'with hope and acting out of hope can cultivate a different kind of \n', 'world worth being hopeful about, reinforcing itself in a virtuous \n', 'spiral.

Her work was focused on \n', 'the Caribbean Islands, including St. Lucia and Belize—until Hurricane Maria \n', 'tore through the region in 2017. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane she \n', 'went to work in Puerto Rico, building microgrids in remote areas that had been \n', 'devastated. Microgrids are technologies that work with existing energy grids, but \n', 'continue working when the energy grid goes down–a commonplace occurrence \n', 'in the remote mountainous regions of Puerto Rico, which became the norm after \n', 'Hurricane Maria.\n', 'It’s estimated that Hurricane Maria caused Puerto Rico roughly $91 billion \n', 'in damages. Keeping the concept of applied hope in mind, Ana Sophia decided \n', 'to bring the microgrid technology to those who needed it most – the children. In \n', 'such a difficult time for the island, she knew she’d need help taking on such a big \n', 'challenge. So she partnered with several organizations such as Save The Children, \n', 'to install renewable microgrid infrastructure in schools, including the schools in \n', 'mountainous communities, which were experiencing the longest outages. More \n', 'than anything, she hoped her efforts would help return these island communities \n', 'to some semblance of normalcy. By the project’s end, Ana Sophia had helped in-\n', 'stall microgrids in 10 public schools, giving more than 4,000 students and faculty \n', 'access to clean, resilient power. “I can’t tell you what it was like when the students \n', 'could see firsthand what is possible. This is what applied hope fosters, in its purest \n', 'form,” she says, smiling.\n', 'As positive as she was, the situation was hard for Ana Sophia to handle at \n', 'some points. “I went home and cried almost every night. I couldn’t believe that \n', 'citizens of the United States had to go to school in the conditions that I was \n', 'seeing. But I never lost hope.

He discovered his calling to civ-\n', 'il and environmental engineering in college, from what he had learned in high \n', 'school from the Congregation of Christian Brothers—to live a life of service. \n', '“That was where I found an intersection of my greatest passion and the world’s \n', 'greatest needs,” he says. “Engineering answers to the world’s problems would be \n', 'the path that I would take from there on.”\n', 'Gary first started on his path of helping people living in poverty get access \n', 'to microloans for clean water and sanitation with Water Partners in 1990. He’d \n', 'read about Dr. Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in 1983 to \n', 'provide micro-credit loans to entrepreneurs, mostly women, in Bangladesh, and \n', 'who had gone on to win the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. “Access to finance was the \n', 'main barrier people always came up against,” Gary says. “They understood the \n', 'issues their communities were facing and what approach was needed to remedy \n', 'their issues. They just didn’t have any savings to do it. In rural areas, the issue is \n', 'usually access to water and the tradeoff is time. A few hours’ walk might get you \n', 'water, but a six-hour walk will get you higher quality water. In either case, there’s \n', 'a lot of cost associated with all of that in lost time. Water Partners has worked to \n', 'alleviate that with our microloan program.”\n', 'In urban areas, the tradeoffs manifest a bit differently. “When there’s no \n', 'water available, people have to pay vendors 10-15 times the amount they’d pay if \n', 'they had the money to get a direct connection to their local utility. The problem \n', 'is that many people may have just $1 a day to buy water from the vendor, but not \n', '$300 to get the necessary connection. So they have to wait in long lines at public \n', 'water faucets, which is another time sink. This is where loans can help in the long \n', 'term.”\n', '257\n', 'Gary quickly realized that the biggest bottleneck was getting access to whole-\n', 'sale capital, which he would need in order to get help to all the people who needed \n', 'it. The problem was just too big to be addressed through microloans.\n', 'As fate would have it, Gary met Matt Damon in 2008 at the Clinton Global \n', 'Initiative. At that time, Matt had been running an organization called H20 Africa, \n', 'which helped supply people with drinking water in rural Africa. After talking with \n', 'Gary, Matt realized that Water Partners had a track record of doing what he was \n', 'trying to do, and he had the name and brand that could help them gain access to \n', 'new and greater levels of funding. They realized that working together they could \n', 'change the future of water. And so, with equally lofty goals in mind, they merged \n', 'their organizations to form Water.org and Water Equity, an investment capital \n', 'project and a sister organization that they hope will be able to scale the work of \n', 'Water.org through wholesale capital.\n', 'Water.org and Water Equity have grown to include a committed team of \n', 'corporate philanthropy and engagement partners helping to provide microloans \n', 'to those in need, including the World Bank, Caterpillar, Mastercard Foundation, \n', 'Ikea, the Bank of America, Pepsi, and the UN General Assembly.\n', 'Gary and Matt are leaders in a new generation of social entrepreneurs who \n', 'are viewing problems like urban and rural water resilience, water scarcity, and \n', 'water-stressed communities through a progressive lens. “To me, social entrepre-\n', 'neurship is basically looking at some of society’s biggest and most overlooked chal-\n', 'lenges and trying to apply more innovative and creative solutions to them,” Gary \n', 'says, pointing out that in hubs like Silicon Valley, it’s of the utmost importance \n', 'for entrepreneurs to fuel value creation. “When you apply that type of mindset \n', 'and ingenuity to social problems, we can remake the world for the better. As a \n', 'global community, we should agree to apply the same level of talent and ingenuity \n', 'to social issues as we do to getting out the newest iPhone.” Gary hopes that his \n', 'work has raised awareness and inspired more people to get involved working on \n', 'a solution to Sustainable Development Goal 6: clean water and sanitation for all.\n', 'In his travels to rural places, Gary noticed that accessing water has a variety \n', 'of social ramifications he’d never really considered—like girls’ education, which is \n', 'among the most concerning. Not having reliable access to water keeps girls out of \n', 'school disproportionately. “In a lot of rural areas, if a family needs somebody to \n', 'spend hours every day waiting in line fetching water, they usually end up sending \n', 'a girl. So they don’t get to spend as much time learning, and occasionally they \n', 'stop going to school altogether.” This is one of the most important reasons to get \n', 'reliable water sources close to peoples’ homes, so that girls can go to school.\n', ' 258\n', 'Perhaps the most widespread and least discussed impact of climate change \n', 'is in terms of water resources and water scarcity. Gary sees climate change as \n', 'potentially preventing hundreds of millions of people getting and maintaining \n', 'access to clean water. “We know that climate change is contributing to stronger \n', 'and more frequent floods, which are occurring with greater irregularity. This puts \n', 'the most vulnerable among us in a very precarious situation. And flooding also \n', 'raises sea levels, which can contaminate wells and make them unusable.” It can \n', 'also interfere with infrastructure, making communities that have gained access to \n', 'water less water resilient. “The way this problem manifests itself mostly is through \n', 'water,” Gary says. “We need to ensure that our communities are resilient enough \n', 'to tolerate the negative effects of climate change in the future.”\n', 'For young people interested in social entrepreneurship, Gary believes that \n', 'education is the first responsibility of any venture that is trying to make a lasting \n', 'impact on the world. “The first thing to do is to study up on sustainability issues \n', 'and understand them inside and out. As you go through that process, you are \n', 'going to see a lot of things that may stand in the way.”\n', 'Gary believes the best way to get overcome these obstacles is by connecting \n', 'with a like-minded community. “In any venture, it’s important to look for people \n', 'who are trying to work on the same problem, and get together with them to try \n', 'and push your shared concept forward. That’s where entrepreneurship comes in. \n', 'Most people individually can see a current problem and how to solve it now. But \n', 'it takes a lot of people working together and looking at what is going to be the \n', 'best way to fix these problems two or three years from now to fully realize what’s \n', 'needed to make that happen.”\n', 'Gary has an inspiring question he says young entrepreneurs should ask of \n', 'themselves. “Once you have the data and the community, it’s time to ask yourself, \n', 'Why not? If there’s a gap that corporations and organizations aren’t able to fill, it’s \n', 'incumbent upon you to fill that gap.” He adds, “I encourage the youth sustain-\n', 'ability leaders and entrepreneurs to go out and try to implement creative solutions \n', 'to the climate crisis.

In his home, Tzedakah –the Hebrew word for charity—inspires \n', 'his family to serve social justice. Not surprisingly, in carrying out this tradition Ben \n', 'Smilowitz has become a leading name in innovative disaster relief efforts.\n', 'By the time Ben was in elementary school, he was already on the path to \n', 'becoming involved in his community and bringing about positive change. “In the \n', 'first or second grade I knocked on my state senator’s door, selling oranges and \n', 'grapefruits for a school fundraiser,” Ben says, recalling his youthful efforts. When \n', 'the senator asked him to get involved in his campaign, Ben’s lifelong foray into \n', 'civic engagement had begun.\n', 'In no time, Ben was touring the state capitol with the senator, learning the \n', 'ropes, and handing out flyers for causes he wanted to support. All the while he \n', 'was asking questions about policies and agendas that he didn’t yet understand. He \n', 'quickly became versed in the workings of local politics thanks to mentoring from \n', 'forward-looking campaigners and staff. And by the age of 8 he had started to \n', 'develop a practical toolkit for impacting local change.\n', 'Next he aimed to get his peers involved. When he was 16 years old, “I read \n', 'that someone had resigned on the state Board of Education,” Ben recalls. “I wrote \n', 'the governor a letter and asked him to appoint a young person.” He wrote a press \n', ' 260\n', 'release announcing that he was launching a campaign to fill the vacant seat with \n', 'a young person. Even though an adult was appointed to that seat, Ben didn’t let \n', 'it deter him.\n', 'He then launched a new campaign to add student seats to the board. This \n', 'time around, he ramped up his efforts. He held public hearings, lobbied, and \n', 'organized multiple press conferences with the media to get the word out. “We \n', 'got about 50 students from across the state to write letters. We created a petition \n', 'and got a few thousand signatures. And then we had about 20 students attend \n', 'our rally, and another 15 students went to the state capitol to lobby. A year and a \n', 'month after our first letter to the governor, we had a bill signing.” Ben and a few \n', 'other students were in the gallery watching the vote, which passed 145 to 0. The \n', 'standing ovation, for a bill Ben had written, brought all of their combined efforts \n', 'to heart. “It was a successful grassroots campaign in every sense, with passion and \n', 'collaboration every step of the way,” Ben says.\n', 'Ben went on to champion a variety of other issues. He founded the Inter-\n', 'national Student Activism Alliance, which aimed to organize young people in \n', 'communities across the country to serve as a student watchdog group, represent-\n', 'ing students’ rights and public education issues. And in Missouri, he helped create \n', 'the nation’s first Youth Cabinet, in which all the cabinet positions were occupied \n', 'by youth.\n', 'No matter what issue he gets involved in, Ben’s message is always about \n', 'getting youth and local communities to act in support of public service. When \n', 'asked what youth need to do to make progress on causes important to them, he \n', 'says, “They need the trust of others. They need validation that they are on the \n', 'right track, that they have the power to do what they’re doing, and that they \n', 'should pursue their ideas.”\n', 'In 2005, when Ben was 24, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the south-\n', 'eastern U.S., wreaking havoc anywhere it touched down. In the immediate af-\n', 'termath of this national emergency Ben decided to volunteer for the American \n', 'Red Cross in Gulfport, Mississippi. And at ground zero, he assisted in a very real, \n', 'practical sense.\n', 'When he first arrived, he noticed from the start that something didn’t seem \n', 'right. Inexperienced, first-time volunteers were being assigned to entire sites with \n', 'extremely difficult, expansive, tough tasks that they weren’t equipped to manage. \n', 'There was little to no accounting of what was being distributed, and to whom. \n', 'This created massive queues: mothers with babies waited in long, hot lines, without \n', 'attention. People with disabilities were suffering and too often neglected. Medical \n', '261\n', 'professionals were unlicensed to operate. Worst of all, in a multiethnic, multiracial \n', 'area, hate groups showed up to intimidate those receiving aid. After experiencing \n', 'all this suffering, Ben learned one of the hardest lessons of his life: sometimes \n', 'there are great obstacles that lie in the way of doing good.\n', '“Don’t get me wrong,” he explains, describing the bungled relief efforts. \n', '“People were extremely generous. Americans and people from other countries do-\n', 'nated all they could to help. However, that aid just wasn’t reaching the people that \n', 'needed it most. I realized that a lot of things could be improved to help more peo-\n', 'ple. We were there to help the people in Mississippi who had lost everything...So, \n', 'I spoke up—and broke policy, by allowing the media to see the mismanagement \n', 'at hand. For the sake of the people who were suffering, I needed them to see what \n', 'the actual needs were on the ground, compared with what we were providing...It \n', 'was tough to point a critical eye at those trying to help those in need. However, if \n', 'they weren’t helping, and were even exacerbating the pain, I felt it just wasn’t right \n', 'for it to go on unchecked.”\n', 'Recognizing the inherent flaws in a system that was trying to fundraise, ex-\n', 'ecute, and coordinate a relief effort simultaneously in the immediate wake of a \n', 'natural disaster like Katrina, Ben saw another way. He knew that with a little \n', 'planning, and a lot of hard work, he could influence the system to work with much \n', 'greater efficiency and help more people more effectively.\n', '“My initial reaction when I got back home was to ask ‘Who is accountable? \n', 'And how do we prevent such mismanagement from happening again?’” He de-\n', 'cided the best way was to start a nonpartisan watchdog organization focused on \n', 'accountability in relief situations. Out of the ashes of his Katrina experience was \n', 'born the Disaster Accountability Project (DAP).\n', 'The three primary issues DAP addresses are 1. Improve the effectiveness of \n', 'disaster relief and humanitarian aid; 2. Make sure help reaches those that need it \n', 'most; and 3. Make sure lessons are learned so we do not make the same mistakes, \n', 'disaster after disaster. DAP has made assessments in the wakes of earthquakes in \n', 'Haiti (2010), Japan (2011), and Nepal (2015).\n', 'In October-November 2012, Superstorm Sandy devastated the eastern \n', 'United States, inflicting tremendous damage on the coastal regions. By the time \n', 'the storm had passed, there were 233 fatalities, $68.7 billion of damage, and over \n', '305,000 homes were lost in New York alone. DAP filed a successful complaint in \n', 'New York against the American Red Cross for gross mismanagement, and won \n', '$4 million, to be released to survivors of Superstorm Sandy. Large victories like \n', 'this, won by such a comparatively small organization, show just how significant a \n', ' 262\n', 'positive impact a few dedicated individuals can make for the people most in need.\n', 'DAP was the first organization of its kind in the industry, and Ben knew \n', 'it was making a significant impact in the world of disaster relief. As a result of \n', 'DAP’s work, millions of misappropriated funds have been recouped, and that aid \n', 'has been reappropriated to the individuals that it was promised to in the wake of \n', 'emergency situations.\n', 'Ever the innovator, Ben knew there was still more he could do to make a \n', 'bigger impact. He understood that having oversight was great, and the result-\n', 'ing accountability was necessary for improving processes and results. But what if \n', 'there were an aspect of the disaster relief cycle that, if addressed, could signifi-\n', 'cantly reduce the number of negative outcomes in the first place? With this ques-\n', 'tion in mind, Ben created yet another answer, in the form of an online system:  \n', 'SmartResponse.org.\n', 'SmartResponse.org is an interactive data repository: through this platform, \n', 'people can identify the local organizations responding to disasters and support \n', 'them directly. “If we can preemptively curate a list of organizations operating \n', 'locally, we can effectively direct donations to deserving local organizations at the \n', 'most critical times. We really want to change how money moves after disasters \n', 'and put the power into the hands of local groups.”\n', 'SmartResponse.org helps to get much needed funds quickly to local food \n', 'banks, community and cultural organizations, disability rights groups, and other \n', 'entities that will be there after the smoke clears and the media’s cameras leave. \n', '“They have the numbers on the ground to react to different situations. This type \n', 'of response strengthens the local economies affected, creates and protects jobs, \n', 'and ensures that money and efforts are also invested into future preparedness and \n', 'mitigation efforts.”\n', 'Given the increasing number of disasters in the world due to climate change, \n', 'both DAP and SmartReponse.org have been well received by local communi-\n', 'ties.

58,Gary Bencheghib,Cleaning Rivers To Keep Our Oceans Clean,264,269,"['Keep Our Oceans Clean\n', 'Gary Bencheghib | Indonesia\n', 'Growing up in Bali, Gary Bencheghib loved walking on the beach with his \n', 'younger brother Sam, and their older sister, Kelly. Bali beaches are famous among \n', 'tourists for their beauty - clean, white sand beaches as far as the eye can see. How-\n', 'ever many of these gorgeous beaches are increasingly being covered with plastic \n', 'litter—from water bottles to straws, and single use products.\n', 'Each week they picked up the litter hoping they could help return it to its \n', 'natural state of beauty. At first Gary thought that the beaches would stay that way. \n', 'But the very next day, there was more trash – plastic waste everywhere. Week after \n', 'week, more plastic kept appearing on the shores.\n', ' 264\n', 'Gary soon realized the sheer volume of garbage on the beaches couldn’t just \n', 'be from tourists and local people littering. It was a much bigger problem. And as it \n', 'turned out, he was right: it was an upstream issue. He soon discovered that Bali’s \n', 'rivers were actually the source of the plastic pollution. People living along Bali’s \n', 'rivers were using them as a garbage dump, since they was no waste management \n', 'system, nor any green alternatives. So Gary and his brother Sam started rallying \n', 'volunteers to clean up plastic pollution from the beaches. They formed Make A \n', 'Change Bali to explore ways to help clean up the riverways.\n', 'Gary was curious to see if other countries had this problem too. They were \n', 'shocked to learn that 150 million metric tons of plastic are in our oceans, and 8 \n', 'million metric tons of plastic waste are added each year – and a sizeable percent-\n', 'age of this waste is from river sources. So Gary and Sam expanded their local \n', 'organization to create Make A Change World to address this problem globally. \n', 'What made their second venture different from their first is that they now decided \n', 'it was equally important to focus on education – knowing that if people didn’t un-\n', 'derstand the consequences of their habits, then they’d have no reason to change \n', 'to greener lifestyle choices. And Gary felt that the best way to educate people \n', 'about the environmental crisis is through film.\n', 'So Gary embarked on an adventure: first he moved to New York to attend \n', 'film school at the New York Film Academy. In conversations with Americans, he \n', 'noticed the same lack of awareness around plastic pollution that he had found \n', 'in Bali – rivers were largely being ignored as a source of ocean pollution. So he \n', 'decided to make his first film about the Mississippi River, the longest river in the \n', 'United States, which runs right through the center of America’s heartland.\n', 'He decided that linking his film with one of the most famous characters \n', 'in American literature, Huckleberry Finn, would be a good way to get people’s \n', 'attention. So he sailed the 2,300 mile length of the Mississippi River on a raft \n', 'constructed of 800 plastic bottles, and created a short documentary series to raise \n', 'awareness of this problem.\n', 'Gary named his raft “Ioco” and he put together a team of skilled engineers, \n', 'who took readings about the health of the river’s water as they traveled. What they \n', 'discovered was frightening. There were unsafe levels of microplastics, extremely \n', 'tiny particles of plastics, in nearly every area they tested. This type of pollution \n', 'is toxic to the fish and harmful to the humans who eat them. “My purpose in \n', 'making the film was to show the problem visually,” he says. “But since you can’t \n', 'see microplastics, you can only measure them, that wasn’t successful in raising \n', 'awareness.”\n', '265\n', 'Thankfully, this problem didn’t stop Gary.\n', 'To get his message across, Gary knew he had to find a way to create a great \n', 'visual. So, as he searched for a great visual image that would inspire action, he \n', 'learned, much to his dismay, that the most polluted river in the world was in his \n', 'very own backyard, in Indonesia.\n', 'The stretch of the Citarum River in West Java is the textile capital of the \n', 'world. There the factories of the world’s largest clothing companies are dumping \n', 'dyes and other pollutants directly into the water, in alarming amounts. To raise \n', 'awareness of this catastrophic issue, Gary and his brother Sam made another film \n', 'as they sailed down the river on two boats made of recycled plastic.\n', 'Downstream from the factories, they saw the water tainted with artificial \n', 'colors from the dyes, dead animals floating in the water, and piles of burning \n', 'trash. What was most shocking to them was that the river was entirely covered in \n', 'plastic. With every stroke of their paddles, their oars would hit another bottle. “It \n', 'really hit me how far we’ve come in the destruction of our planet,” Gary says. “I \n', 'just wanted to do everything I possibly could, every day of my life, to clean the \n', 'environment and save the planet.”\n', 'Gary and Sam’s first video went viral overnight. “Our little journey, travel-\n', 'ing on a raft of plastic bottles, became international news,” Gary says. “We were \n', 'speechless! We were finally starting to get the attention that this movement needs.”\n', 'People all over the world began messaging Gary and Sam online to find \n', 'out ways they could help. Four months later, the brothers were invited to meet \n', 'with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. They talked about the urgency of the \n', 'Citarum’s situation and he assured them that he would personally see to it that \n', 'they receive help to address the problem. Gary and Sam were very pleased when \n', 'he declared a “garbage emergency” a few months later. In February 2018, he \n', 'mobilized 7,000 military troops for a cleanup campaign, with a seven-year com-\n', 'mitment. Gary joined in, with check-ins every 2-4 months, to see the progress that \n', 'was being made, and to learn from the cleanup effort what he could bring to the \n', 'rest of the world.\n', 'One day while observing the workers, who were both troops and technical \n', 'experts from the Ministry, Gary had an idea for a new kind of monitoring process. \n', 'What if we could measure the things we can see—like plastic bottles-as well as the things we \n', 'can’t see—like lead, uranium, and toxic chemicals in the water? he asked himself. Would that \n', 'make a difference? He envisioned this new system as a way to exchange knowledge \n', 'and best practices from the global community, who’d been reaching out to him in \n', 'droves, wanting to help.\n', ' 266\n', 'Sungai Watch is an open-source online platform that uses geographic soft-\n', 'ware like GIS and AI to track ocean cleanup in real time. It then provides data \n', 'on what pollutants are in the water. This allows scientists to determine which \n', 'cleanup methods – barriers, skimmers, or other technologies—are most effective. \n', 'This open sourcing of environmental solutions encourages the global community \n', 'to share both data and technologies, so that effective solutions can benefit more \n', 'communities, and can become refined through applying collective wisdom.\n', '“It’s exciting, exchanging ideas and methods from around the world,” Gary \n', 'says. “But to be most effective, we really need local communities to inform our \n', 'work.” The local communities he works with span from Jakarta to Singapore and \n', 'beyond. And it’s in these local communities that he’s found valuable knowledge \n', 'about things that he didn’t know about prior. For example, they know the local \n', 'irrigation channels, and how seasonal things, like monsoons, can impact places \n', 'on the equator. “The monsoon effect causes cities on the equator to produce a \n', 'disproportionate amount of plastic pollution, because when the rivers swell, it \n', 'sends garbage into the oceans. These are the kinds of things we’re now learning \n', 'from people around the world.” He adds, “Now more than ever, we need our \n', 'global community to inform our decision making.”\n', 'For young people looking to make an impact on the environment, Gary has \n', 'two main messages. One is that positivity bridges all divides. “We learned early on \n', 'to always take a positive approach,” he says. “No pointing fingers. This isn’t about \n', 'blame, it’s about finding solutions. We want to help, and we don’t want anybody \n', 'to feel as if they need to apologize.”\n', 'Gary also believes that big, far-reaching ideas are what the movement needs \n', 'most. “No idea is too crazy!” he says. “We need big ideas, and we need risk takers \n', 'to go above and beyond to put these wild and crazy ideas into action. That’s the \n', 'only way for us make sure we sustain the planet for future generations.”\n', 'As a filmmaker, Gary is always thinking of new ways to get his environ-\n', 'mental message out to the world.

But he had to travel halfway around the world and \n', 'back before he fully realized how important his upbringing was in shaping him for \n', 'environmental advocacy.\n', 'At 19, James left home for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, \n', 'with the esteemed Morehead-Cain scholarship. “It changed the course of my \n', 'life,” James says. “Once I got here, I began living like a digital nomad, out of a \n', 'suitcase. And I got involved with studying renewable energy in North America, \n', 'Latin America, and the Caribbean.”\n', 'At UNC James met his mentor, clean-tech entrepreneur and energy sector \n', 'veteran Danny Kennedy, who helped him hone his environmental skills. “Danny \n', 'gave me a lot of the tools I needed to grow and helped me understand how the \n', 'industry works. If you don’t understand that, you’ll have a lot harder time making \n', 'an impact.”\n', 'At age 21, while a sophomore in college, James joined his first major en-\n', 'deavor, Solar Head of State, a nonprofit organization whose mission is “to help \n', 'world leaders become green leaders.” Its vision statement explains: “Working with \n', 'governments, we install solar photovoltaic systems on iconic buildings, leveraging \n', 'their visibility and social impact. We support world leaders to champion solar, \n', 'acting as a catalyst for wider adoption of new solutions for renewable energy.”\n', '269\n', 'This small organization made waves with its campaign to install solar panels \n', 'on the White House during Barack Obama’s presidency, and James was brought \n', 'on board later as a cofounder. “I don’t believe in starting up new organizations for \n', 'the sake of it,” he says. “I really believe that this was an opportunity to grow an \n', 'existing campaign that had stalled and help take it to new heights.”\n', 'Solar Head of State also made a big splash when they partnered with the \n', 'President of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed. The Maldives, a small island de-\n', 'veloping state (SIDS), is a chain of islands in the Indian Ocean whose highest point \n', 'is just 2 meters; they’ve been seriously impacted by coastal sea rising and even a \n', 'tsunami. Nasheed, who was featured in the movie The Island President, dramatically \n', 'showed the precarious situation of his country by holding a cabinet meeting un-\n', 'derwater, fully dressed in scuba gear. He also made sure that the Maldives was the \n', 'first country to install solar power at an executive residence.\n', 'Other island nations, from Jamaica to St. Lucia, have followed Nasheed’s \n', 'lead. Over the next two years, 12 new solar installations are lined up for Pacific \n', 'Island nations. The Youth Solar Challenge, put on by Solar Head of State and the \n', 'Caribbean Youth Environment Network, invites young people to create unique \n', 'communications campaigns, to educate their communities about green energy. \n', 'Successful campaigns in Jamaica and Guyana have already been implemented, \n', 'with more to come. Time and again, James has seen that regardless of the inno-\n', 'vation, it is local leaders who drive its adoption. He points to a recent Yale study \n', 'that showed that community leaders who install solar in their homes convince \n', '62 percent more residents to join them vs. those who didn’t. According to James \n', 'another problem is that too often scientists and techies miss the “soft skills” needed \n', 'to get their message across. He uses his communication and collaboration skills to \n', 'bridge this gap.\n', 'His experiences with Solar Head of State challenged James to delve deeply \n', 'into finding solutions for the problems small island nations face. He discovered \n', 'that they have similar challenges: building roads and schools; recovering from nat-\n', 'ural disasters; developing sustainable trade practices; and dealing with the isola-\n', 'tion of their remote locations. Most significant is the challenge of creating reliable \n', 'alternative energy resources. “Take, for example, the Caribbean,” James explains. \n', '“On average, they pay 3-6 times more for electricity than Americans. This leads \n', 'to “energy poverty”—people who just can’t afford it. And it’s not reliable when \n', 'it’s frequently bombarded by tropical storms with high winds, rains, and flying \n', 'debris.” He adds, “Since islands are the most vulnerable to climate change, it’s \n', 'important to have alternative ways to provide energy, in case of a disaster.”\n', ' 270\n', 'When he was 24 James’s journey led him back to the U.K. to attend the \n', 'University of Highlands and Islands in Northern Scotland. “The conversations \n', 'happening on Caribbean islands are also happening on Scottish islands,” James \n', 'says. “Issues of energy poverty, rural infrastructure, and communication were the \n', 'same, halfway across the globe. That’s when the lightbulb went off!”\n', 'From his travels, James had gained a unique vantage point on how things \n', 'operate in different countries. He knew how to interact with governments and \n', 'their communities, and how to get investors. He’d seen that solar technology \n', 'means different things to different communities. In East Africa where the poor \n', 'use solar, it has a lower-class stigma. This makes it hard to convince people that \n', 'the technology is worthwhile. “If we want to expand renewable energy, we need \n', 'to understand where the needs are different, and where they are the same,” James \n', 'says. “An island-networking community!” And that is how Island Innovation was \n', 'born.\n', '“Islands are particularly vulnerable to climate change,” James explains. “A \n', 'single event can knock out an island’s economy. A hurricane won’t affect 100 \n', 'percent of the U.S., but it clobbered Puerto Rico. Island people need to work \n', 'together and learn from each other. What works, what doesn’t work. How can we \n', 'get engineers and politicians to communicate effectively across their disciplines? \n', 'Things like that.”\n', 'Island Innovation brings together business, government, utilities, NGO’s, \n', 'universities, and citizens to explore innovations and share best practices in sus-\n', 'tainability on island settings worldwide. In our modern, ever-connected world, it \n', 'has taken a modern, tech-savvy approach, by a modern, tech-savvy individual, \n', 'to leverage these new means of communication in the service of island nations. \n', 'James’s mission is to strengthen communities on island nations; strengthen the \n', 'bonds between them; and build their knowledge base, to help them face their most \n', 'pressing collective challenge—climate change.\n', 'To bring disparate island communities together, James began by asking \n', 'questions: “What has Fiji done that Hawaii can learn from? How can Scotland \n', 'have a conversation about sustainability with Jamaica?” He developed the Virtual \n', 'Island Summit, a free annual online event, connecting global island communities \n', 'on a common digital platform. During the Summit, people from around the world \n', 'come together virtually, to share ideas, innovations, and the best practices they’ve \n', 'come up with to deal with the challenges of island communities.\n', 'When the inaugural Summit was held in October 2019, world-class experts \n', 'shared their knowledge with more than 100 island communities from the Arctic \n', '271\n', 'to the Pacific Islands and beyond. Participants raved about the experience, which \n', 'was focused on learning and cross-sector collaboration. “Amazing things hap-\n', 'pened that week,” James says. “Someone in our Facebook group from Vanuatu \n', 'posted about a solar project. A reply came from Jamaica. Then from Scotland. \n', 'Then, in a single thread, people from all over the world were communicating. \n', 'That’s what the Virtual Island Summit is all about.”\n', 'James believes this kind of remote collaboration will create great change \n', 'going forward. “Virtual meetings are often seen as a last resort for professional \n', 'collaboration, but when we’re talking about rural island communities, they often \n', 'don’t have the money to travel from afar.

At The Island School, 50 stu-\n', 'dents from all around the world live together on a remote campus for a semester. \n', 'And as they learned about sustainability, leadership, and marine biology issues, \n', 'they would also strive to live as sustainably as possible. “It really checked a lot of \n', 'boxes for the things I was interested in, and I was lucky enough to be accepted,” \n', '273\n', 'he says.\n', 'Alex’s time in the Bahamas was a wonderful learning experience. However, \n', 'one thing that really bothered him was the way the country discarded plastic \n', 'waste. At home, he grew up recycling everything—especially plastics. He learned \n', 'to be conscious of the importance of doing this, since islands have very limited \n', 'space for landfills. He was shocked to see that plastic was simply being tossed into \n', 'pits with the rest of the trash. Then, once the pits were full, they were lit on fire. \n', 'The thick, nasty, terrible-smelling smoke would fill the air. “It was awful,” he says.\n', 'An even greater source of pollution was the island’s source of energy. Gen-\n', 'erators as big as houses burned diesel fuel around the clock to supply the islanders \n', 'with energy. “The oil gets shipped in on huge barges and then they just burn it,” \n', 'Alex explains. “And they’re old generators, they are not efficient.”\n', 'The sight of these generators spewing ugly black smoke across the light blue \n', 'Bahamian skies was sickening to Alex.

A turbine of this size would be able to satisfy 15 percent of \n', 'the energy needs for the island’s middle and high schools with a clean, renewable \n', 'source of energy: wind power.\n', 'First, they would have to overcome many obstacles. Locals worried that a \n', '131-foot turbine in the center of the island that was visible from almost anywhere \n', 'on the island would be an eyesore. They were also concerned about how this \n', 'would affect the island’s main economic engine: summer tourism.\n', '“One of the hardest issues was convincing the Nantucket Historic District \n', 'Commission that this was good for the island,” Alex says. “Getting them to ap-\n', 'prove a wind turbine and convincing them that it wasn’t going to negatively im-\n', 'pact the historical integrity of the island was a huge challenge.”\n', 'Like most wind turbines, the turbine Alex and his schoolmates were plan-\n', 'ning was supposed to be white.

And awareness of the importance of renewable energy on \n', 'Nantucket has only grown over the years—from dialogues with business leaders \n', 'and influential seasonal residents, to teachers who have incorporated wind power \n', 'into their lesson plans. “It’s a great tribute and a successful case study for our \n', 'island,” he says.\n', 'Alex’s passion, commitment, and hard work was noticed: in 2011 he and his \n', 'classmate Will Horyn were nominated to serve as youth delegates to the Stone \n', 'Soup Leadership Institute’s 7th annual Youth Leadership Summit for Sustainable \n', 'Development.

It was \n', 'an ambitious dream for someone who’d never worked in that field. Unfortunate-\n', 'ly, he soon realized that becoming successful fisherman in retirement was pretty \n', '277\n', 'tough. After many struggles and failures, he decided it’d be wiser to continue the \n', 'life he knew, in police work. But that wasn’t the end of the story...\n', 'In time, the Rasos would achieve this dream through Perry, who from an \n', 'early age grew up clamming in the pristine waters of Point Judith Pond. “In many \n', 'ways, my dad’s vision inspired me,” he says. “Luckily, I was able to pick up the \n', 'dream where he left off.”\n', 'Perry started out by digging shellfish when he was about 12 years old, with a \n', 'commercial fisherman he knew. “I still remember the first time I went out digging \n', 'for clams,” he says. “When I pulled my rake out of the water, I couldn’t believe it. \n', 'I was thinking, that’s 7 or 8 bucks worth of clams! I knew that the harder I pulled \n', 'on the rake and the longer I did it, the more money I’d make. I liked being able to \n', 'determine how much I made by how hard I worked.”\n', 'And he would be working hard. Clamming is an extremely physically de-\n', 'manding job; clammers work in all seasons, including wading in icy New England \n', 'waters in the middle of winter. It’s not for the faint of heart.\n', 'When he first started clamming, the specialized rake Perry used to dredge \n', 'the pond with must have been taller than he was. At his TedX talk, he brought \n', 'one of the rakes onto the stage and showed the audience how you drag the rake \n', 'through the mud to catch clams. “There I was, just a kid, standing in chest-deep \n', 'water, pulling on the handle,” he explained. “Every few minutes I’d pull the rake \n', 'up, and shake the sediment out.” And he’d repeat this action, over and over again \n', 'throughout the day, rain or shine. But, as tough as the work was, it gave him the \n', 'background he needed for commercial fishing.\n', 'Perry was off to a promising start. Still, he knew he needed a proper educa-\n', 'tion if he was going to become the successful businessman he knew he could be. \n', 'So, he studied aquaculture and fisheries technology at the University of Rhode \n', 'Island. Upon graduation in 2002, with the help of a Reed Aquaculture initiative \n', 'grant, he had the tools and experience he needed to start his first sustainable \n', 'venture - the one-acre Matunuck Oyster Farm. It was an instant success.\n', '“When I first started selling oysters at local farmer’s markets, the reaction \n', 'was fantastic,” he says. “I didn’t expect everyone to say that the oysters I was \n', 'offering tasted better than what they were used to. It made me feel great. But \n', 'more importantly, I realized that there was a tremendous untapped market for \n', 'local, sustainable seafood. Far bigger than my small operation was capable of \n', 'supporting.”\n', 'Before long, he was farming two acres to fill the gap. Then three acres; then \n', 'seven. Locally, his organic product was such a hit that he eventually expanded \n', ' 278\n', 'his operations nationally. In fact, he was expanding so fast that he bought the \n', 'only commercial property available in East Matunuck on the pond—which was a \n', 'rundown clam shack.\n', '“When I started the Matunuck Oyster Bar 10 years ago, I didn’t expect much \n', 'from it,” he says. “I bought the place because I needed the dock. But to my sur-\n', 'prise, it worked really well as an oyster bar. And then I saw an opportunity to make \n', 'my restaurant even more sustainable.

It’s an alternative approach that can help save struggling \n', 'farmers. And the data says the opportunity is there for entrepreneurs who want \n', 'to make a mark.\n', 'According  to  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration \n', '(NOAA), the United States is the leading importer of fish and fishery products in \n', 'the world: 90 percent of the seafood consumed in the U.S. comes from abroad – \n', 'and more than half of that is sourced from aquaculture. What this amount to is a \n', '$14 billion seafood trade deficit that can be addressed on the home front of New \n', 'England’s pristine waters.\n', 'However, the specter of climate change is raising concerns. Many of the \n', 'shellfish raised—like mussels, oysters, and clams—are especially vulnerable to \n', 'extreme weather conditions. “If the waters increase in temperature, the growing \n', 'season increases,” Perry explains. “That means the amount of time the oysters \n', 'can be stressed increases, since most of the stress occurs during the summer. So \n', 'more extreme weather increases the occurrences of the conditions that can lead \n', 'to disease and ultimately, mortality.

62,Elliot Connor,Human Nature Projects,281,285,"['Human Nature Projects\n', 'Elliot Connor | Australia\n', 'It was a clear night in northern Botswana. Ten-year-old Elliot and his family \n', 'had set up camp for the night, with their tents grouped around a little campfire. \n', 'There was nothing around, except the infinite expanse of the veld, the stars in the \n', 'clear night sky, and the sounds of the bush. Elliot was trotting along behind his \n', 'parents and his big brother, on the way back from the campground bathroom to \n', 'their tents.\n', 'Suddenly, he sensed a movement behind him, and he froze—they were in \n', 'the wilderness after all. There were all sorts of animals around. He turned around \n', 'slowly.\n', '“There, about two meters behind me, was a young leopard, crouched quite \n', 'low to the ground,” Elliott remembers. “It was stalking me.”\n', 'For three never-ending seconds, Elliot looked right into the leopard’s eyes. \n', 'Luckily, at that very moment, his older brother turned around, flashlight in hand. \n', 'The beam of light scared the leopard away; but for the rest of the night Elliot and \n', 'his family stayed in their tent while the leopard kept circling the camp site. His \n', 'father stood guard by the fire, with a bottle of wine and a shovel in his hands.\n', 'Elliot would never forget this encounter with the leopard. From the time he \n', 'was a small child, animals had been an important part of his life. His parents were \n', 'passionate bird watchers and he often tagged along with them, using their old \n', 'camera gear to take pictures. When his family moved from the U.K. to Australia \n', '281\n', 'when he was five, his passion for animals only continued to grow.\n', 'But as he grew older, he realized that animal species around the world face \n', 'a lethal enemy. Human activities have decimated natural habitats and changed \n', 'the climate, which causes many species to go extinct. According to UN estimates, \n', 'about 200 plant, insect, bird, and mammal species are disappearing from our \n', 'planet every day.\n', 'To fight this trend, conservationists around the world are trying to educate \n', 'people about the need for saving endangered species. When he was 15, Elliott \n', 'decided that he wanted to turn his passion for animals into doing something. So \n', 'he started volunteering with the Birdlife Australia Discovery Center, which was \n', 'just around the corner from a local park in Sydney. But soon he understood that \n', 'there was a long way to go.\n', '“It was quite a shock for me,” he says. “All the volunteers were at least 70 \n', 'years old. And there were almost no visitors coming through.”\n', 'Elliott was appalled to see how isolated the field of conservationism was in \n', 'Australia. So, six months later, he decided to start his own club for naturalists. It \n', 'was the first of its kind in Sydney. The main purpose of it was just to try to inspire \n', 'more people to go outside and experience nature. He also joined many other \n', 'organizations, and volunteered wherever he could. In fact, he put in more than \n', '300 hours of volunteering in just12 months—but in all that time, he never met \n', 'anyone his age.\n', 'His volunteer work also took him abroad. In January 2019, Elliot was work-\n', 'ing in a rescue center for raptors and hedgehogs in southern France. One night he \n', 'was doing research into various conservationist organizations, when he realized \n', 'that many of the websites he was looking at were decades old. A lot of the organi-\n', 'zations had ceased operations, and even the well-established ones were struggling \n', 'to incorporate young volunteers.\n', '“It was very difficult for me as a minor, to work my way into these organiza-\n', 'tions so I could gain experience,” he remembers. “That is sort of what triggered \n', 'it for me.”\n', 'Taking long winter walks through the beautiful landscape of southern France, \n', 'he started wondering what could be done to get young people involved in con-\n', 'servationism. “That’s where a lot of the philosophy for Human Nature Projects \n', 'came about,” he says. “It’s designed as an entry point for volunteers. We’re trying \n', 'to promote it as a very accessible, engaging, community form of conservation.”\n', 'For Elliot, it was the beginning of a very exciting project: in June 2019, he \n', ' 282\n', 'officially founded his organization, Human Nature Projects. It has quickly grown \n', 'into a decentralized network of more than 1,400 activists in 110 countries. “We \n', 'want to empower each of our volunteers as an individual, and help them create \n', 'the impact that they want to make,” Elliot explains. “But we also recognize the \n', 'power of the collective.”\n', 'The semi-independent country teams organize their own outreach and \n', 'fundraising efforts, and projects, which ensures that their activities have the biggest \n', 'possible impact on the local level. The teams organize a wide range of activities: \n', 'the Australian team has just started a campaign on bush fires, while the team in \n', 'the Congo is focusing on climate change, and volunteers in Uganda are fighting \n', 'to rescue chimpanzees.\n', '“I think it just goes to show the power of being able to link up such passionate \n', 'youth leaders, and supporting and engaging them in this process,” Elliot says.\n', 'For Elliot, who describes himself as an introvert, it was hard to take the \n', 'initial step of presenting his ideas and his vision to a wider audience. “The biggest \n', 'challenge was having the confidence in myself, being able to just put myself out \n', 'there,” he says. “In a sense, I just needed to have the ambition to aim for some-\n', 'thing so large.”\n', 'But even during the very first meetings with other activists for Human Na-\n', 'ture Projects, Elliot felt that he had created something that could inspire others, \n', 'not just himself. “It was an amazing realization that I was able to speak with peo-\n', 'ple all around the globe,” he remembers. “That’s something I never even dreamed \n', 'of. I’m very introverted myself, I never took on leadership roles in school.”\n', 'But Elliot is dedicated to the issue: when he first started his project, he would \n', 'work on it after school, from 5 pm until 9 pm, trying to learn more about the \n', 'underlying problems at night. It was tiring, and in the beginning, responses to his \n', 'outreach work were slow to come in.\n', '“You just have to have the perseverance to move on,” Elliot says. “You have \n', 'to find new routes, be creative about how you set about projects like this.”\n', 'Elliot knew for sure that the issue of conservationism needed a new ap-\n', 'proach, and a new generation to take up the fight. Being a resource- poor field, \n', 'conservation projects often struggle with a lack of funding. But there are also \n', 'issues of duplicated efforts and miscommunication, he says.\n', '“We need to redefine how we’re measuring our impact,” he says. “We need \n', 'to work through the people first. We need a community-centric model of conser-\n', 'vation. This means changing the perspective of communities—which is obviously \n', '283\n', 'the root cause of these problems.”\n', 'That is why Elliot came up with the four C’s of conservation: Connection, \n', 'Curiosity, Creativity, and Collaboration. For him, it is all about educating and \n', 'engaging people in the fight for animals, and changing their perspective on nature.\n', '“Increasingly, we’re learning that animals are just as intelligent, just as com-\n', 'plex as we are,” he says. “My life goal is reframing our relationship with nature. I \n', 'think if we can reevaluate what it means to be human, then that is the ideal way \n', 'to be able to live alongside animals.”\n', 'It is therefore a central part of Elliot’s work to make people appreciate the \n', 'nature around them and build a community around a positive message on conser-\n', 'vation. “The positive side of things is often lost when we talk about conservation,” \n', 'he says. “In order to get people involved in the cause, you need a positive message \n', 'about how we all can contribute our share to saving nature.”\n', 'Elliot’s Human Nature Projects is a successful example of this approach. \n', 'He has an Excel spreadsheet on his computer, with the names and contact infor-\n', 'mation of over 1,400 volunteers around the world, working to save endangered \n', 'species.\n', '“When I scroll through it, it feels amazing, I can’t quite describe it,” he says. \n', '“Seeing all of the volunteers conducting these amazing projects is definitely what \n', 'drives me forward.”\n', 'When Elliot finishes high school in November, he is planning to take the Hu-\n', 'man Nature Projects to the next level.

In the evenings, she enjoys learning about new \n', 'advances in scientific communities around the world. They give her inspiration \n', '- and plant seeds for her ideas. Gitanjali has a knack for developing inventions of \n', 'one kind or another. “Many of my inventions have been inspired by just watching \n', 'the news.”\n', 'Over time, she noticed disheartening stories running each day on climate \n', 'change. She started thinking deeply about all the different crises that her country \n', 'was facing. Thanks to her good education in STEM—Science, Technology, Engi-\n', 'neering and Math - she had a strong scientific base. She wondered what could she \n', 'do - with her affinity for tinkering, and the joy she gets from problem solving—to \n', 'help people who are suffering.\n', 'Gitanjali’s first venture was a response to the public health water crisis in \n', 'Flint, Michigan. “When I saw the TV broadcast from Flint, I was appalled. I \n', 'couldn’t believe how many kids my age were drinking lead poison everyday. And \n', 'this causes lifelong health problems. It was just so unfair. And no one was doing \n', 'anything about it.” The inadequate re- routing of the public water system resulted \n', 'in highly toxic levels of lead in the water supply. Hundreds of thousands of people \n', 'in the region were being affected since 2015. “The worst part is that by the time \n', 'people realize a problem like this, one that oftentimes can’t be physically seen, it’s \n', 'almost too late. They already have consumed it, and will suffer the negative effects \n', 'for the rest of their lives.”\n', '285\n', 'At age13, Gitanjali created Tethys to detect lead contamination in drinking \n', 'water sources. With this invention, people can assess—in real time—if their drink-\n', 'ing water has safe levels or not. The implications for places like Flint are enormous. \n', 'Gitanjali’s Tethys gained the attention of many national outlets - including by 3M, \n', 'which awarded her a $25,000 prize for winning their Young Scientist Challenge in \n', '2017. Now she is looking to partner with an incubator to raise funds and expand \n', 'the reach and breadth of chemicals she can test for. “Finding partners to expand \n', 'this idea is going to help me evolve into being an entrepreneur, not just an inventor. \n', 'As an entrepreneur, hopefully I can reach a lot more people.”\n', 'Another national health crisis Gitanjali learned a lot about on the news was \n', 'the opioid epidemic. Over the last decade, the opioid crisis has wreaked havoc on \n', 'communities in the United States. Since 2016, roughly 45,000 people a year have \n', 'been killed by opioids, mainly by overdose – and what’s especially tragic is that \n', 'roughly 2,100 of these overdoses a year occur in youth ages 15-24. Aside from \n', 'overdoses, there are many negative health-related consequences from the misuse \n', 'of opioids. Prescription opioids—from sports injuries - make up the majority of \n', 'health emergencies nationally. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n', 'estimate that for every overdose a youth has related to opioids, there are 119 emer-\n', 'gency room visits and 22 treatment admissions. In October of 2017, the opioid \n', 'epidemic became so impactful, that it was declared a public health emergency.\n', 'Gitanjali knew she wanted to do something about the opioid epidemic, even \n', 'though it on the opposite side of the scientific spectrum from her first invention. \n', '“I knew it wouldn’t be easy. But I like to solve problems affecting those in my age \n', 'group. I can relate more closely to problems that way.” And so she began working \n', 'out a biological solution to help with the prescription opioid addiction impacting \n', 'youth everywhere. And so she created Epione.\n', 'Epione is an app connected to a testing device, that detects how addicted \n', 'someone is or isn’t to opioids. The test detects the protein produced by a specific \n', 'gene when it comes into contact with prescription opioids. So the higher the pro-\n', 'tein level, the higher the indication is for opiates. “It’s sort of like a litmus test for \n', 'ph. An easy to read color strip shows on the app, and you can see where a person \n', 'is on the spectrum of addiction. The app also has corresponding maps to local \n', 'counselors, physicians, doctors, and others where youth can get help.” For this \n', 'invention, she won the TCS Ignite Innovation Student Challenge.\n', 'Gitanjali was horrified to see how many young people her age were strug-\n', 'gling with was bullying. Bullying—physical, verbal, and social. Direct, or passive. \n', 'In person and online. As a technically minded student, she began focusing on a \n', ' 286\n', 'way to help prevent a modern form of bullying that has been on the rise in recent \n', 'years – cyberbullying.\n', 'It’s estimated that around 5 million students a year are bullied, either in \n', 'person or online. This has serious mental health consequences for both the bully \n', 'and the victim. From higher rates of anxiety, suicide, depression, substance use, as \n', 'well as declining academic achievement. According to the HHS, over 60 percent \n', 'of youth who experience cyberbullying are significantly challenged to learn and \n', 'feel safe at school.\n', 'To help combat this epidemic, Gitanjali designed the app Kindly. Kindly \n', 'is an extension that can be added on to web browsers, social media sites, and \n', 'other mobile and desktop applications, that helps parents, educators, and students \n', 'alike detect potential bullying incidents – and stop them before they happen. It \n', 'highlights text that may be problematic, and blocks it, or allows it to be sent with \n', 'adjustments, depending on the severity of the language. In the near future, Gi-\n', 'tanjali hopes schools will adopt her app, and act as the first line of defense for \n', 'protecting victims of bullying.\n', 'For the youth who want to explore a similar path to Gitanjali, she has a few \n', 'words of wisdom surrounding fun, community, togetherness, and the hands-on \n', 'nature of a practical STEM education. “Whatever you are trying to learn, have \n', 'fun with it. Create communities to support your ideas. Learning happens most \n', 'productively when people can learn together. Don’t be afraid to make it hands-on. \n', 'Lectures have their place. But hands-on learning skills with real world experts is \n', 'the quickest way to becoming proficient. This sort of STEM training needs to be \n', 'in all of our classrooms.”\n', 'Gitanjali believes that the support of adults is critical for those youths pur-\n', 'suing their educational goals. “If we’re talking about parents, support whatever \n', 'your child wants to learn. If you are a teacher, do the same for your students. \n', 'We’ve all got a dream in mind, and it’s hard to follow that dream when you don’t \n', 'have support. I couldn’t imagine approaching such complex problems without \n', 'that support structure.”\n', 'Gitanjali also recommends that parents learn with their kids, and even try to \n', 'learn new things themselves as inspiration. Her advice is the same to adults who \n', 'approach learning themselves, “Have fun with it. There’s never a limit to fun. I \n', 'like to say, Go after it like a teenager!”\n', 'As a youth leader in STEM, who is vocal about advancing female involve-\n', 'ment and leadership in tech, Gitanjali has a message to women and girls. “I had \n', 'a mentor say to me, ‘Don’t go into it thinking you’re a girl or woman in tech.’ \n', '287\n', 'You are going after big ideas. You are solving incredibly complicated problems. \n', 'You are creating and inventing things. No matter who you are, these things are \n', 'commendable. So don’t qualify what you are and aren’t.

Salvador didn’t wait a second to spring \n', 'into action.\n', 'He was only 15 years old, an enterprising ninth grader at a private school \n', 'in San Juan, when Hurricane Maria hit. He excelled in his classes. But Hurricane \n', 'Maria was not a class exercise. All around him, people were really dying. It has \n', 'been estimated that more than 4,000 people were killed during Hurricane Maria, \n', 'but the actual number is likely much higher. We might never know exactly how \n', 'many lives the hurricane took: what we do know is that in the days and weeks \n', 'following the storm, people were hungry, unwashed, and plunged into darkness.\n', 'Salvador didn’t have the power to turn “five loaves of bread and two fish” \n', 'into enough nourishment to feed the multitudes, but he was determined to do \n', 'what he could. Knowing that the storm had knocked out power across the island, \n', 'he realized two things. Without electricity people would feel unsafe going into the \n', 'streets after dark; and they would have trouble washing their clothes, which could \n', 'lead to a number of preventable illnesses, not to mention a pervasive feeling of \n', 'uncleanliness that would negatively affect their mental health over time.\n', 'Salvador knew that Puerto Rico’s strong sun—the same sun that gives el-\n', 'derly residents heat stroke, and forces Puerto Ricans to carry umbrellas during \n', 'the day—could provide the energy to power new equipment. Solar power could \n', 'make it possible for people to cleanse themselves, protect their families, and feel \n', 'safe during the night. It could also help usher in new modes of sustainable living \n', 'that would last well after the power had come back on.\n', 'Salvador calculated that a donation of around $100 could provide a solar \n', 'light, a mobile phone charger, and a hand-crank washing machine to a family in \n', 'need. With the help of his mom and Neha Misrah, the cofounder of Solar Sister, \n', 'a nonprofit that distributes solar panels to women entrepreneurs in Africa, he \n', 'started a GoFundMe campaign and called it Light and Hope for Puerto Rico. \n', '“Neha was my guiding light and mentor from the beginning,” Savador says.\n', 'His GoFundMe campaign was an immediate success.

In only four days they had raised $36,000. \n', 'Within the first three weeks, the campaign had raised $65,000. Salvador shared \n', 'his story online so people from around the world could help too. In the end, more \n', 'than 1,200 people pledged more than $160,000—enough to provide 3,500 house-\n', ' 290\n', 'holds with solar light, mobile phone chargers, and nonelectric portable washing \n', 'machines.\n', 'But he didn’t stop there: he began researching, and then reaching out to or-\n', 'ganizations that could help.

Soon other companies of-\n', 'fered to pitch in: Gentlewasher, EasyGo, Mpowerd, Schneider Electric, and Om-\n', 'nivoltaic Energy Solutions. The crowdfunding campaign grew into a movement, \n', 'defined by a simple, universal equation: C + Feel = Hope (See + Feel = Hope).\n', 'In the wake of the storm, good news in Puerto Rico was hard to come by. \n', 'Perhaps that’s why the media took notice of Salvador’s campaign.

While some kids were spending their \n', 'weekends playing video games, Salvador was out in the streets teaching people \n', 'how to use the lanterns and set up the washing machines. His goal was simple: \n', 'to hand out solar lanterns, phone chargers, and washing machines until the need \n', 'was completely met; or until every single light came back on.\n', 'Salvador traversed the entire island, going door to door to deliver the sup-\n', 'plies. He started by delivering supplies in the town of Loiza, which had been \n', 'devastated by the eye of the storm. But soon community leaders from other towns \n', 'learned about the project, and asked if he could help them out, too.\n', 'He ended up visiting 17 towns, as well as a pediatric hospital in San Juan. \n', 'When he saw the desperation of people’s situations, it inspired him to keep going. \n', '“I hadn’t really seen, really experienced, what people were actually living,” he says. \n', '“But when you’re there, you’re literally among piles of debris, piles of clothes, of \n', 'belongings, that are just broken or wet or destroyed, or just gone.

65,Nainoa Thompson,Navigating By The Stars,293,296,"['Navigating By The Stars\n', 'Nainoa Thompson | Hawaii\n', 'Nainoa Thompson was in awe when he first saw the Hōkūle’a, a traditional \n', 'Polynesian voyaging canoe that navigates by the stars without using any West-\n', 'ern implements. In 1976 the Polynesian Voyaging Society’s now famous flagship \n', 'project had set sail from Hawaii to Tahiti, retracing the original journey taken by \n', 'Nainoa’s ancestors, the first time such a vessel had completed this journey in over \n', '600 years. “I was in Tahiti when it arrived,” Nainoa says, reflecting back. “17,000 \n', 'Tahitians flocked to the port—so I climbed up a monkey-tail tree just to be able to \n', 'watch it make landfall. I didn’t know what the future held, but I sensed how histor-\n', 'ic this moment was. And I knew I was going to be a part of that future somehow.”\n', '293\n', 'Nainoa had grown up on a dairy farm in Niu Valley on the island of Oahu \n', 'when it was still an agricultural community. Here, Nainoa’s first teachers were \n', 'close to the land—and close to home. “My mother was a great inspiration for \n', 'me. She would always make us go out into the bush, and encouraged us to spend \n', 'our days in nature. She had the spirit of all the great naturalists, and it rubbed off \n', 'on me.” Another teacher that guided Nainoa was Yoshi Kawano, a family friend \n', 'and worker who lived on the dairy farm. “Yoshi was my great teacher about the \n', 'ocean,” Nainoa says. “One day he gave me a four-foot bamboo fishing pole and \n', 'took me to Maunalua Bay. With this gift, I found a place of wonderment where \n', 'I could really be at peace with myself. As a kid, a lot of things didn’t really make \n', 'sense to me—but the ocean did.”\n', 'With modernization, industrialization, and an influx of people that the \n', 'land couldn’t support, Niu Valley changed. Nainoa saw two different ways of \n', 'living, and realized that the effects of this modern approach couldn’t be sustained. \n', '“Growing up, there was no question as to why the natural world would need to be \n', 'protected,” he says. “To watch the world change so rapidly without being able to \n', 'do anything about it, and watch the things you value, and love, get destroyed; it \n', 'was a helpless feeling.”\n', 'Nainoa devoted himself to learning more about environmental issues, which \n', 'wasn’t easy. “When I was in high school, sustainability wasn’t even a word. Climate \n', 'change wasn’t taught. We were really unprepared to deal with these issues in every \n', 'way.” Nainoa also struggled with his Hawaiian identity, since that wasn’t taught \n', 'in schools either. “I realized that people don’t care to protect something they have \n', 'no connection to,” he says. “And so I realized why our Hawaiian identity and \n', 'heritage, which is so deeply connected to this place, was being ignored. Reviving \n', 'one’s understanding would inevitably awaken both. I realized that as a culture \n', 'going forward, we needed a new kind of teaching so that the next generation of \n', 'Hawaiians would be better prepared than we were.”\n', 'In the early 1970s, Nainoa found exactly the community of educators he \n', 'was looking for with the Polynesian Voyaging Society (PVS). After witnessing the \n', 'Hōkūle’a arrive in Tahiti, Nainoa was eager to learn from these great navigators. \n', '“I owe all that I am to the great navigators and educators who gave of themselves \n', 'to build me up,” he says. “Mau Piailug. Katharine Luomala. Ben Finney. And \n', 'perhaps my greatest influence from a sustainability perspective, Lacy Veach.”\n', 'Lacy Veach was Hawaii’s second astronaut, and he made a great impact \n', 'on Nainoa’s crowning achievement with the PVS, the Worldwide Voyage. “He \n', 'taught me about the Island Earth, which is how he saw it from outer space. And \n', ' 294\n', 'how fragile and interrelated everything is. It’s also when he realized that down on \n', 'earth, our solutions don’t evade us because of an absence of technology, but an \n', 'absence of culture. He planted the seed that we need millions of trained ‘naviga-\n', 'tors,’ both metaphorically and literally, to build a future of values and education. \n', 'He saw the parallels between navigating space and the PVS. And he was the one \n', 'who instructed me to sail Hōkūle’a around the world to continue to inspire these \n', 'values.”\n', '“With the Hōkūle’a, I’ve witnessed the Hawaiian Renaissance in real time,” \n', 'he says. A government mandate to teach the Hawaiian language has had a pro-\n', 'found impact on this island nation. “Before the Hōkūle’a, there were less than \n', '100 native speakers left on the islands,” Nainoa says. “Now there are more than \n', '22,000 native Hawaiian speakers.”\n', '“The PVS and Hōkūle’a has given us hope. It’s showed us that we need to \n', 'change our relationship to the earth, and we need to educate ourselves about \n', 'how to get back to more sustainable ways. And it’s shown that in navigating by \n', 'our shared values and navigating by the power of community, we can change \n', 'anything. To put it simply, our relationship with Hawaii was renewed.”\n', 'Nainoa has since devoted his life to reviving ancient Hawaiian traditions \n', 'that were nearly lost. Whether he is working on cultural preservation, environ-\n', 'mental advocacy, or championing sustainable education for Hawaiian youth, he \n', 'credits everything he’s achieved to the guidance of generous teachers. “I’m not \n', 'a particularly smart or courageous person. If you read a headline about some of \n', 'the things I’ve done, you might think that,” he says. “But you’d be wrong. I owe \n', 'everything I’ve done to the great teachers I’ve been fortunate to learn from in my \n', 'journey of life.”\n', 'Nainoa has been involved with all of the Hōkūle’a’s voyages after the initial \n', 'one, and has remained a central navigator for the PVS since the early 1970s. \n', 'Over a period of 45 years, his voyages have totaled more than 250,000 nautical \n', 'miles—the equivalent of circumnavigating the earth 20 times. From 2014-2017, \n', 'the Worldwide Voyage covered 41,000 miles, visited 322 ports, and heard stories \n', 'from concerned communities all over the world who are suffering from climate \n', 'change. “It’s clear that if we don’t do anything to combat climate change, there’s \n', 'going to be a lot of suffering,” Nainoa says. But he adds that there’s reason for \n', 'hope. “We met extraordinary people doing work in environmental and cultural \n', 'spaces. We learned from hundreds of Indigenous communities that have been \n', 'sustained for thousands of years with the common understanding that Mother \n', 'Earth will take care of it all, if we take care of her.”\n', '295\n', 'Nainoa is now planning the launch of the Moananuiākea Voyage in 2022. \n', '“We are planning to circumnavigate the Pacific, since the engine of environment is \n', 'the Pacific. It regulates climate, food sovereignty, distribution of temperature—all \n', 'of the most important issues of sustainability for the 21st century.” For this bound-\n', 'ary-breaking voyage, Nainoa has advocated for youth involvement at all levels of \n', 'the process. “We’re mandating that at least a third of the 300-person crew has to \n', 'be under the age of 25, so that these skills are passed on to the next generation.”\n', 'Nainoa is hopeful about the future. “Within weeks of asking for youth volun-\n', 'teers for the Moananuiākea Voyage, we had to start turning people away—which \n', 'is a good thing. It shows us that the young people are ready to fight for cultural \n', 'and environmental preservation.” And Nainoa is glad that they are taking up the \n', 'mantle. “My generation couldn’t crack the code to build a sustainable world, but \n', 'I think that these amazing young people can—and will.”\n', 'If I have courage, it is because I have faith\n', ' in the knowledge of my ancestors.\n', 'Mau Piailug\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'To learn more about the Polynesian Voyaging Society,\n', 'visit www.hokulea.com\n']","['climate education sustainable living', 'Hawaii Polynesian Voyaging Society', 'Indigenous knowledge', 'Indigenous languages', 'Indigenous peoples Hawaii', 'islands Polynesian Voyaging Society', 'languages, Indigenous', 'oceans Polynesian canoe voyages', 'Pacific Ocean', 'Piailug, Mau', 'Polynesian Voyaging Society', 'Thompson, Nainoa', 'Veach, Lacy']"

Growing up in the vibrant city of Quito, Ecuador, she was surrounded by \n', 'marvels of nature on all sides. Ecuador is home to many rare and unique natural \n', 'environments. This country on the equator contains everything from misty cloud \n', 'forests to glowing, active volcanoes dotting the horizon.\n', 'Ecuador has the distinction of having the planet’s greatest biodiversity per \n', 'hectare. Among the rare animals found there is the spectacled bear, which exists \n', 'only in a narrow ribbon of land in South America. There are also the many \n', 'endangered species of the Galapagos Islands, such as the giant tortoise. Ecuador \n', 'is also home to the world’s largest flying bird, the Andean condor. All of these \n', 'unique species drove Daniela to want to understand how to protect and preserve \n', 'them and their environments, whether they be in the forests, grasslands, or the \n', 'ocean.\n', '“When I was young, my family used to take long trips from the city to the \n', 'coastline. Growing up surrounded by nature really molded my life and my ap-\n', 'preciation of the environment. I found that being around pristine nature in such \n', 'a beautiful place is really necessary for happiness. I always had an innate feeling, \n', 'even from the time I was very young, that these natural wonders had to be pre-\n', 'served.”\n', 'When she was 7 years old, Daniela moved with her mother to Chicago, to an \n', 'urban environment that couldn’t have been more different from where she lived \n', 'in Ecuador. “Landing in Chicago and looking out my window, it was flat land all \n', 'around. As a kid, not seeing any mountains or nature around scared me. It made \n', 'me appreciate what I had back home.”\n', 'At age 12, she had a wake-up call. Walking home from school one day, she \n', 'passed a shop window and saw something that would change her life. “I remem-\n', 'ber looking at this movie poster that had a penguin walking on sand – it turned \n', 'out to be An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore’s documentary on climate change. So, I \n', 'ran to the Blockbuster, because my favorite animal was a penguin and I wanted \n', 'to understand why it was walking on sand. I got the movie, I was so excited... and \n', 'the next thing you know, I’m in tears, learning about what could happen to our \n', 'environment and to the penguins that I adore, the animals I love, and our entire \n', 'climate. It was a catastrophe. But it opened my eyes to the reality.”\n', 'After that Daniela dedicated her life to protecting our environment. She \n', 'talked awareness, took environmental classes, and raised money to get solar panels \n', 'for her high school. She even got involved with the debate team, with aspirations \n', 'of running for office so she could influence environmental policy. And she en-\n', 'rolled at Georgetown University, which has strong connections with Washington’s \n', '297\n', 'environmental political leaders.\n', 'As a freshman there, she had another life-changing experience when was \n', 'invited to a meeting at the United Nations on the state of our oceans. “I was well \n', 'versed in climate change, but this was the first time I’d heard any discussion about \n', 'the role the ocean plays in the larger climate ecosystem. And I quickly realized I \n', 'was the only young person in the room, learning about what’s happening to our \n', 'oceans. I also noticed a few things that the older people wouldn’t. One was that \n', 'there were not many communication channels. There was no livestream. And no \n', 'social media getting this information out to my generation. I also realized that \n', 'everybody was talking about problems, sharing these doomsday statistics; but no \n', 'one was talking about solutions. No one had any hope about the innovations \n', 'that could move things forward. I left that meeting feeling completely devastated \n', 'because I had learned that our ocean was dying. And I also felt a sense of urgency \n', 'to let the world know, to let my own generation know, that this was something that \n', 'we had to pay attention to, because no one was talking about it.”\n', 'On the train ride back to Washington after the meeting in New York, Danie-\n', 'la had a eureka moment. She realized that she could do a lot more as an entrepre-\n', 'neur than as a policymaker. With this thought in mind, she picked up a pen and \n', 'pad. “I just started sketching out this model. It was literally two bubbles. In one \n', 'bubble I wrote ‘young people.’ In the other bubble, I put the names of influential \n', 'people, like various businessmen and high-level politicians. Then I put a concen-\n', 'tric circle in the middle and thought, this is what the Sustainable Ocean Alliance \n', '(SOA) needs to be. A platform where young people can interact with high-level \n', 'leaders so they can learn from them. But on the flip side, young people can also \n', 'contribute to the solutions that these high-level people are looking for, that they’re \n', 'not finding. That’s how the SOA was born.”\n', 'Back at Georgetown, she hosted the first ever Sustainable Ocean Summit, \n', 'and 500 students from across the country attended. Daniela incorporated her \n', 'forward-looking ideas into the agenda for the meeting, with the help of U.S. Sec-\n', 'retary of State John Kerry and the U.S. State Department. The meeting was \n', 'streamed to all the U.S. embassies around the world: some even had Embassy \n', 'watch parties, so young people from other countries could be involved.\n', '“This was the catalyst that really kicked SOA into high gear. After that meet-\n', 'ing, I had countless students from around the country asking me, How can I bring \n', 'this back to my own university, country, city? So, I built a toolkit to help others rep-\n', 'licate what I’d done. It made such an impact that after graduation, Georgetown \n', 'gave me a two-month stipend to raise the funds to create this nonprofit.”\n', ' 298\n', 'Daniela quickly became one of the leading youth activists in the sustainable \n', 'oceans space. She moved her headquarters to San Francisco, for proximity to an \n', 'innovative startup culture, and started building out various aspects of her orga-\n', 'nization.\n', '“There’s a lot of innovation here,” she says. “Our Ocean Leadership pro-\n', 'gram provides resources and mentorship for young, aspiring leaders to build hubs \n', 'in their regions.

But it also gave him the ability to create things and see them take shape. \n', 'He always knew that he wanted to make something that would have an impact—\n', 'whether that be on environmental, social, or economic issues.\n', 'He didn’t know it at the time, but his neighbor Scott Kennedy shared the \n', 'same dream.\n', 'Fergus and Scott grew up in the same neighborhood in Glasgow, Scot-\n', 'land—a ten-minute walk from one another. They attended the same high school, \n', 'though they didn’t know each other too well at the time. It wasn’t until they both \n', 'attended the University of Strathclyde that they discovered how much they had \n', 'in common.\n', 'When the two young men were placed on the same team for a class project \n', 'as part of their entrepreneurship program, it turned out to be a fortunate pairing.\n', 'In addition to their passion for entrepreneurship, the two shared a few other \n', 'things. Both young men were working in coffee shops to pay for school. After \n', 'making thousands of coffees—and throwing out filter after filter of spent grounds \n', 'at the end of their shifts—they had both started to realize something. It wasn’t just \n', 'one “aha! moment,” in particular, but many smaller ones over time. They realized \n', 'that coffee grounds, like cups and straws, represented a major source of waste that \n', 'the industry hadn’t really taken into consideration. Each year, in the tiny country \n', 'of Scotland alone, between 40,000 and 50,000 tons of coffee grounds are thrown \n', 'away. Across the UK, it’s half a million. Worldwide, that number is exponentially \n', 'higher.\n', 'Most of the coffee grounds in the world end up in massive, smelly landfills, \n', 'where they emit methane—a major greenhouse gas that is contributing to nearly \n', 'half of global warming. By 2050, as many as 3.4 billion tons of food waste will \n', 'enter the global waste stream—and coffee grounds are a small, but nonetheless \n', 'important, part of this.\n', 'Fergus and Scott knew it didn’t have to be that way. “We were seeing first-\n', 'hand the amount of food waste in general that was going out in the trash at the \n', 'end of every single shift, and it was something that didn’t feel right to us,” Fergus \n', 'says. “It felt like there was definitely more value there. It seemed to be something \n', 'that people could use.”\n', 'And so, at the age of 23, they teamed up to try to develop a solution to all that \n', 'coffee-ground waste. Overwhelmed with the scale of the issue, they began with \n', 'some online research. They discovered many ways that used coffee grounds could \n', 'be reused and recycled: as fertilizer or compost, as a natural face scrub, even as \n', 'insect repellent. Someone just needed to figure out an effective and business-savvy \n', '301\n', 'way to turn this waste product into something useful. As thrifty Scotsmen, the \n', 'idea was compelling. As enterprising entrepreneurs, they decided to give it a shot.\n', 'What started as a class project has now turned into a full-scale company \n', 'called Revive Eco. After three years of work in the lab, Fergus and Scott are test-\n', 'ing out their creation. They weren’t the only people who believed in the project. \n', 'A grant of a quarter of a million euros from Zero Waste Scotland helped them \n', 'develop the technology and test it in a lab before taking it to the real world. And \n', 'they’re still just 26.\n', 'In Scotland, coffee shops play an important cultural role. They’re hubs for \n', 'intellectual and philosophical discussion. They pulse with a unique energy, and \n', 'provide a cozy space where people can take shelter from the country’s harsh el-\n', 'ements: wind, rain, and fog. Young people especially flock to them—in Glasgow, \n', 'Edinburg, Aberdeen, Inverness, and elsewhere too.\n', 'There are more than 20 coffee-roasting companies in Scotland, and each \n', 'year Glasgow hosts a renowned international coffee festival. The coffee culture \n', 'is thriving, but that comes with an unfortunate byproduct: massive amounts of \n', 'waste. “The initial shock was just the volume of waste,” Fergus says. “When you \n', 'go into Starbucks and get your cappuccino, you don’t see the waste. Even if you \n', 'do see it, it just seems like such a small, little puck of waste, you don’t really think \n', 'about how much that all adds up when you take the millions and billions of people \n', 'drinking coffee every single day.”\n', '“You hear about carbon emissions, but once you actually start looking into \n', 'the numbers, it’s difficult to comprehend: the number of hectares of forest being \n', 'chopped, the number of tons of coffee waste, the number of tons of palm oil, the \n', 'number of carbon emissions. It’s really hard to even fathom,” Fergus says.\n', 'Fergus and Scott are leading the way to a better world, and so is their coun-\n', 'try. Scotland was the first country in the world to set a goal of running 100 percent \n', 'on renewable energy by 2020—and they have actually reached it. Offshore wind \n', 'farms like the Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm and the Seagreen Wind Farm pro-\n', 'vide clean energy to hundreds of thousands of Scottish homes.\n', 'Now the country is bringing its waste goals in line with its renewable energy \n', 'ones.

The govern-\n', 'ment plans to remove all plastic packaging from products by 2030, and to reduce \n', 'food waste by one-third in the coming years. For Fergus, the most important thing \n', 'was to tackle food waste in a reasonable and down to earth way. To take things \n', 'one step at a time. “For us, what we are doing just makes sense,” he says. “We’re \n', ' 302\n', 'driven by logic.”\n', 'Despite being a small startup, they’re already speaking with some of the \n', 'biggest players in the coffee industry.

68,Sainath Manikandan,Robots For Fighting Plastic Pollution,304,307,"['Robots Fighting For Plastic Pollution\n', 'Sainath Manikandan | United Arab Emirates\n', 'Sainath Manikandan once read a story about the famous environmentalist, \n', 'Dr. Jane Goodall. She’d helped him to see that no matter how small a step might \n', 'seem, the tiniest effort can eventually make a huge difference. He was just a young \n', 'boy in school, but he had paid attention when she said that it didn’t matter how \n', 'old someone was; what mattered was the action they took to move the world into \n', 'the right direction.\n', 'So Sainath decided to start where he would be able to make a change—in \n', 'his own school. He’d seen that a lot of his classmates in the United Arab Emirates \n', '(UAE) used single-use plastics in their everyday lives. He found this extremely \n', 'concerning.\n', 'He’d first noticed the impact of single-use plastics when he had visited his \n', 'family’s hometown in India when he was 8 years old. “It’s normal for people in \n', 'India to use single-use plastics, like straws, cups, and plastic bags in their day-to-\n', 'day lives,” he remembers. “But there just isn’t enough room to dump all of the \n', 'waste. There were small pieces of plastic everywhere.” So the plastic ends up \n', 'being tossed in the streets and then ends up in the rivers and lakes.\n', 'Sainath was bothered enough by this that when he got home he did some \n', 'research. “This is a problem all over the world,” he says. “An estimated amount \n', 'of eight million tons of plastic ends up in the world’s oceans every year.” If that \n', 'continues, it is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than \n', 'there is marine wildlife. These shocking numbers made Sainath wonder what he \n', 'could do about it.\n', 'To start, Sainath created a campaign to collect plastic trash and old elec-\n', 'tronics from his classmates. Once every three months he would hand over all the \n', 'trash he had collected to the Emirates Environmental Group for recycling. “At \n', 'first, it wasn’t such a big deal,” he says. It was a just a project he had started with \n', ' 304\n', 'some friends, placing some trash cans in the school to collect plastic waste, and \n', 'convincing other students to stop using single-use plastics.\n', 'Then one day one of the teachers overheard Sainath talking to his friends \n', 'about the project. That’s when his PEPC (Papers, E-waste, Plastics, and Cans) \n', 'campaign moved to the next level. “She wanted me to give presentations about \n', 'our project to students in other classes,” Sainath says. “Soon more people realized \n', 'that they needed to get involved.”\n', 'It took some time, but eventually, as more students joined the effort, the \n', 'scope of the project grew. Together they started collecting plastic trash outside, \n', 'educating others about the importance of sustainability, and even planting plants \n', 'and trees around their school. Some students started bringing waste from home \n', 'that wouldn’t have been recycled otherwise.\n', '“It was really inspiring, and it gave me the energy I needed to move forward,” \n', 'Sainath says. He realized that what was happening was exactly what he’d learned \n', 'from the story about Jane Goodall: it just took one person to take one small step \n', 'in the right direction to create a much larger wave of change.\n', 'Around this time Sainath joined other young changemakers by becoming \n', 'a member of Jane Goodall’s Roots & Shoots Programme in the Emirates. “It’s \n', 'about raising awareness, reaching others, and taking small steps that will create a \n', 'big difference in the future,” he says.\n', 'By now he realized that it wasn’t going to be enough to tackle the issue of \n', 'plastic pollution by just collecting trash before it gets to the oceans. After all, there \n', 'is already an astonishing amount of plastic there. So he started to think about how \n', 'the plastic already in the ocean could be collected.\n', 'Because the United Arab Emirates has both desert and coastline, it is a \n', 'country with a strong interest in fighting environmental pollution and climate \n', 'change. Therefore, technology is often used there to tackle important problems, \n', 'like the lack of water for agriculture.\n', 'Sainath started thinking about how there might be a technical solution to \n', 'the problem of marine plastic pollution. He had started going to robotics classes \n', 'when he was 9 years old. Now he started wondering if his knowledge of robotics \n', 'might be used to address this problem.\n', 'He decided to apply what he’d learned about robotics and put his skills to \n', 'work. And with the support of his teachers and his parents, he worked tirelessly \n', 'to develop a robot that would be able to collect plastics from water sources. There \n', 'were many technical problems to solve: how to make the robot float, how to col-\n', '305\n', 'lect the plastic from the water, where to store the collected plastic, and how to \n', 'protect the robot’s sensitive electronics from the water.\n', '“I used recyclable materials, like plastic bottles, popsicle sticks, pencils, and \n', 'sheet glass to make my robot float on the surface of the water,” he explains. His \n', 'robot—which he calls Marine Robot Cleaner (M-Bot for short)—has three little \n', 'motors: two of them act as paddles, and a third motor in the front is used to push \n', 'the plastic trash into a basket attached to the robot’s back.\n', 'With his robot Sainath aims to protect marine habitats and work toward the \n', 'UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. The robot is only a \n', 'prototype at this point, but Sainath has already showcased it on various occasions, \n', 'like UAE Innovation Month, the Dubai Makers Faire, the Masdar Festival, and \n', 'the Abu Dhabi Chamber’s Future Entrepreneurs.\n', 'Once he produces the robot on a larger scale, he hopes to build an even \n', 'bigger version of it that will be able to collect up to 15 tons of plastic before \n', 'returning to shore. The batteries can then be charged with solar panels, making \n', 'the robot completely carbon neutral. A Global Positioning System (GPS) can be \n', 'installed in the robot for navigational purposes, and a rotatable wireless camera \n', 'and sensor can be fitted. This will sense whether the water is clean, and if it is, will \n', 'send a signal to the robot to stop the process.\n', 'Sainath’s invention has earned him multiple prizes, awards, and interna-\n', 'tional recognition. He is even in discussions with a large company about program-\n', 'ming the robot to clean up rivers and lakes, and someday maybe even the oceans.\n', 'While developing his robot, Sainath realized the importance of learning \n', 'from past mistakes. “I always take feedback from people on how I could improve \n', 'my robot,” he says. He then goes over his design choices to figure out ways to \n', 'make his invention work even better.\n', 'For Sainath, this is also an important lesson for adults around the world to \n', 'think about.

69,Vincent Kimura,Sustainable Farming For Our Future,307,311,"['Sustainable Farming For Our Future\n', 'Vincent Kimura | Hawaii\n', 'Born in Honolulu, Vincent Kimura grew up listening to his grandfather’s \n', 'stories. He’d been a risk-taker who had pursued his own romantic version of the \n', 'American dream. After a major earthquake in Tokyo, he left everyone and every-\n', 'thing in Japan to join his uncle on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. There he would \n', 'find work in the sugarcane fields. The work was hard and the days were hot. But \n', 'as tough as the work was, the land provided, as it does for those who respect it. \n', 'Soon, he’d realize his dream of owning and operating his own business.\n', 'Vincent’s father had a similar drive to see the world. And so he moved the \n', 'family back to Asia for a new life and a better path. Growing up, Vincent experi-\n', 'enced the worlds of Hong Kong, Beijing, and Malaysia, and learned to appreciate \n', 'the beauty of each. But wherever he was, he always remembered his grandfather’s \n', '307\n', 'stories of working in the sugarcane fields. He felt a pull toward the tradition of \n', 'working the land. And so he decided early on in life that he was going to pursue \n', 'his own daring dream. He was going to go against the cultural tide of fast money. \n', 'He wanted to heal the broken patterns that the world–especially the world of \n', 'agriculture–had fallen into. He decided to dedicate his life to protecting the envi-\n', 'ronment, and the small farmers who’ve always known how to care for it.\n', 'Vincent made the necessary sacrifices, and moved to the mainland Unit-\n', 'ed States. He wanted to learn everything he could, so his first step was to earn \n', 'his bachelor’s degree in environmental science at Oregon State University. After \n', 'graduation, he worked first at the Pacific Basin Economic Council, then at the \n', 'accounting firm KPMG, and finally at the Institute for Triple Helix Innovation, \n', 'where he was able to see how academia, industry, and government can work to-\n', 'gether for social and economic advancement. He studied innovative approaches \n', 'to sustainability around the world. Gradually, with guidance from his mentors \n', 'Bernice Glenn and Robert Lees, Vincent was ready to make his mark in the world \n', 'of sustainable farming.\n', 'Since then, over the years he has built multiple green businesses to help \n', 'small farmers. Inovi Green develops alternatives to toxic indoor cleaning products. \n', 'AgriGro’s line of green products adds beneficial microbes to the agricultural cycle. \n', 'And his most impactful venture, Smart Yields (SY), gives farmers access to up-to-\n', 'date data on their land through the use of a mobile app that provides real-time \n', 'monitoring and analytics of their crops. With this powerful information, small \n', 'and mid- sized farmers can plan ahead and achieve a greater degree of precision \n', 'in their agricultural practices. This high level of precision means less waste, lower \n', 'costs, and a more sustainable cycle.\n', 'But as a data man, Vincent knows just how unsustainable our current ag-\n', 'ricultural systems are. “Small farmers are struggling,” he says, quoting the most \n', 'recent USDA data. “Since 1997, we’ve lost nearly 200,000 farms, over 50 million \n', 'acres of land. And 100,000 of those farms have been lost in just the last seven \n', 'years.” Vincent is especially concerned that the number of family-owned farms \n', 'has fallen by 170,000, while corporation-owned farms have increased by 26,000.\n', 'Vincent listens to farmers share their concerns; and they believe this rapid \n', 'change should be seen as a warning. More big agribusiness adds up to increased fi-\n', 'nancial pressures on small farmers. When farmers are struggling to survive against \n', 'the power of agribusiness, it affects whole communities. Prices drop. The “little \n', 'guy” can’t compete. Corporations don’t need to buy local, so they don’t. Money \n', 'generated from the land doesn’t stay in the community. Local shops are no longer \n', ' 308\n', 'supported, so they suffer too.\n', 'A small farmer struggling is a sign of an unsustainable community. Small \n', 'farmers, who are on the front line of climate change, are just not prepared to face \n', 'its threats. A system with less diversity. Fewer viewpoints. Lost traditional, local \n', 'knowledge. And this unsustainable cycle is repeating itself in small rural farming \n', 'towns across the United States. It is a serious threat to our country’s food security.\n', 'Vincent is committed to helping repair this endangered cycle all over the \n', 'world. Thanks to SY, small farmers now have access to the same technology as big \n', 'corporations, at their fingertips. This makes for healthier, more competitive, and \n', 'more productive farms.\n', 'Vincent first tested SY’s advanced technology in Colorado in 2017. Steve \n', 'Ela is a fourth-generation family farmer there who has 80 acres of orchards. SY’s \n', 'app allows him to micromanage his fruit trees, which is critical, especially when \n', 'unpredictable bouts of freezing weather hit. “Climate change is going to shake up \n', 'what we know as normal,” says Steve. “Every year adds another data point.” But, \n', 'he adds, there is strength in numbers; when all farmers in the community pool \n', 'their data, their region is stronger.\n', 'Edward Tufts, another Colorado farmer, has a 500-acre organic orchard in \n', 'the Rocky Mountains. Thanks to SY, his business, Leroux Creek Foods, was able \n', 'to save a crop of Honeycrisp apples during a late frost. “It can cost $500 an acre to \n', 'heat an orchard through the frost season” he explains. “This system, which I can \n', 'easily monitor on my phone, reduces my expenses by allowing me to operate more \n', 'efficiently.” For Edward, this savings was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n', 'But the impact of SY goes far beyond dollars and cents. It makes the farm-\n', 'ing cycle more sustainable every step of the way. This technology has made such a \n', 'positive impact in the world of sustainability that it was accepted in the first round \n', 'of the Vatican’s inaugural accelerator program, called the Laudato Si’ Challenge. \n', '“When the Vatican officially recognized that climate change is real, it sent a uni-\n', 'fying message around the globe,” Vincent says. “As business leaders, we can’t put \n', 'profit first. We have to respond with what’s best for future generations. This is the \n', 'way Indigenous peoples lived...I’ve really redefined my perspective as a CEO. The \n', 'journey isn’t about the next billion dollars. There are larger things at play.”\n', 'What Vincent really likes to talk about is bridge-building through mentor-\n', 'ship, education, and professional development training. “I’ve always been a prob-\n', 'lem solver,” he says. “It is part of my personality. I’m always looking for better, \n', 'faster, more efficient ways of doing things. And that goes for mentorship, which \n', 'has been core to my ethos. So I ask myself, what are we not taught about when we \n', '309\n', 'are embarking on an entrepreneurial journey?”\n', 'Some of the most valuable lessons Vincent learned along his own journey \n', 'he learned by getting involved with local civic groups. “Right out of college, I \n', 'went into Rotary Youth Leadership training. There, I learned how to manage \n', 'insecurities and ego. Every journey can be fraught with mental health challenges. \n', 'Burnout. Depression. Countless other things. Entrepreneurs need to understand \n', 'this early on. When they see the signs of these things, they should take a step back,” \n', 'he says. “We need to be taught about these things to be able to recognize them.”\n', 'Vincent has found that this wisdom is rare in the world of farming. “Nowa-\n', 'days, farmers are really struggling with mental health issues,” he says. Increased \n', 'pressures—very long days, unpredictable weather, delinquent loans, rising debts, \n', 'bankruptcies—has farmers fearing they will lose everything, including their fam-\n', 'ily’s hard-earned legacy. Suicides are at the highest level in decades. “We need to \n', 'change our perspective and talk about these things without judgment,” Vincent \n', 'says. “No matter where you are, you aren’t alone. There’s a tribe of people out \n', 'there who can support you.” Vincent finds that getting his hands in the soil is the \n', 'best therapy. Growing vegetables is being used to treat PTSD in veterans, and \n', 'others. “Once someone feels that connection to the earth, there’s a pathway to \n', 'healing,” he says.\n', 'Vincent believes that if we act quickly, with some structural changes we can \n', 'reestablish a healthy, sustainable approach to agriculture–and to our whole way \n', 'of life. There are models to learn from all over the world, he says, and mentions \n', 'innovative field design in the Netherlands as an example. Then he adds, “In Ha-\n', 'waii we can learn from our native systems.

It \n', 'was July 2010, and a looming energy crisis was taking hold of the world. Her driv-\n', 'er was waiting in a long line of cars at a filling station, hoping to refuel before the \n', 'pumps ran out. Which wasn’t guaranteed– nothing was during the crisis. There \n', 'was a massive shortage in oil supply, and this sort of wait had become normal.\n', 'As she waited, exhaust came through the windows, polluting the air she \n', 'breathed. It clouded the atmosphere around the lines of cars as well. Everything \n', 'felt cramped and suffocating. The streets were polluted. The expressions on wor-\n', 'ried faces all around her were difficult to take in. As Azza looked around at the \n', 'seemingly hopeless scene, a thought struck her: Why are we so dependent on oil?\n', 'There had been peaks and valleys in the price of oil before. But this time \n', 'it was particularly harmful. In the year from July 2007 to July 2008, the price of \n', 'crude oil had risen from $60 a barrel to nearly $140. This impacted all sectors \n', 'of the economy, and wreaked havoc in the daily lives of countless people around \n', 'the world.\n', 'Many factors were contributing to this situation. Climate change. Political \n', 'hostilities in the Middle East. Dwindling oil reserves. An increase in global de-\n', '311\n', 'mand for oil from developing regions. Financial speculation.\n', 'But as complicated as these reasons may be, the reality for the average per-\n', 'son was quite simple: a crushing increase in the price of oil. And since oil is so \n', 'entangled in global markets, an oil shortage makes the prices of many other goods \n', 'and services rise dramatically as well.\n', 'This obviously affects lower income people disproportionately. The price \n', 'of heating oil skyrockets. People have to make this-or-that choices at the market. \n', 'Stress levels go off the charts. And of course, there is that one hallmark of any \n', 'supply issue surrounding oil: long lines at every filling station in sight.\n', 'But sometimes, out of chaos can come clarity. And in a somewhat ironic \n', 'twist of fate, it was in one of those frustrating filling station lines that Azza’s jour-\n', 'ney as a youth leader in alternative energy began.\n', '“After that day, I often thought about how to approach our dependency prob-\n', 'lem,” she says. Then one day at 14, she had a moment of revelation on another \n', 'car trip, from Alexandria to Cairo.\n', '“As we were driving, I saw this huge landfill. We passed by it slowly.

What if somehow we could use all this waste to solve the \n', 'energy crisis?”\n', 'It all started moving really fast from there. Azza had a lot of questions. And \n', 'so, with the support of her family, who are all very scientifically minded, she dove \n', 'deeper into learning about plastic waste. “That’s the second biggest category of \n', 'waste, behind paper waste,” she explains. “So there was no shortage of material \n', 'to work with. In time, I started studying how waste can be converted to fuel.” But \n', 'of course, as just a teenager, she was limited in her knowledge.\n', 'Luckily, at 15 years old, she was welcomed by the Petroleum Research Insti-\n', 'tute in Cairo, to work with two of their scientists, Dr. Tarek Fahmi and Dr. Mam-\n', 'douh El Melawy, on the project. “They were amazing mentors to me,” she says.\n', 'Azza and her team ended up utilizing an existing catalyst in a different pro-\n', 'cess that can break down plastic waste and turn it into fuel that can power vehicles. \n', 'Even more amazing, this catalyst is significantly cheaper than the catalysts that \n', 'were being commonly used prior to their discovery.\n', 'This discovery has huge implications on the climate change front and beyond. \n', 'Because the process is cheaper, more people will adopt it.

So, I decided to study abroad. I applied to a university \n', 'in Canada, to study electrical or environmental engineering—-but I didn’t make \n', 'it. I didn’t get the required scores to qualify. That was a really devastating period \n', 'for me. I’d won these competitions. Received praise for my accomplishments. And \n', 'then, just like that, I suddenly felt like a failure.”\n', 'But sometimes, fate has a way of pointing us in the right direction, even \n', 'though it’s hard to see sometimes, especially at the time.\n', '“I continued to study electrical engineering at Alexandria University.

Our \n', 'Principal of the Day program increased business awareness of the challenges \n', 'facing schools, and the Job Shadow Day program connected executives like Elliot \n', 'with students who were curious about his company, Just Deserts.  By connecting \n', 'with these young people, business leaders discovered the joy of sharing their own \n', 'journey while at the same time investing in their future workforce.  Elliot had \n', 'grown up in a housing cooperative in the Bronx, so the idea of being “a cooper-\n', 'ative human being” has always just seemed natural to him. In fact, every day on \n', '317\n', 'his way to school he saw a motto painted on the wall of the electric power plant \n', 'he walked by: COOPERATION EQUALS POWER. So when he decided to go \n', 'into business, he did so with sustainability in mind. “We just didn’t want to waste \n', 'anything,” he says. “It was ingrained in us.” Those values helped make his family’s \n', 'business, Just Desserts, not only socially responsible, but profitable.

He often felt \n', 'alone and isolated—like he was different. And he struggled with accepting those \n', 'he felt were “different” too. Thankfully, when he was 15, he went to Camp Rising \n', 'Sun in New York, an international gathering of youth leaders who practiced the \n', 'tenets of Radical Inclusion.\n', 'At Camp Rising Sun, each summer, 60 young men and 60 young wom-\n', 'en practice leadership skills in a supportive community of peers and counselors. \n', 'There Jonah found himself mingling with youth from more than 35 different \n', 'countries, celebrating their different cultures and ways–and practicing Radical \n', 'Inclusion. He became fascinated by the wonderful diversity in all things – food, \n', 'culture, language, you name it. “On Saturday nights, we’d sing a song called ‘Ev-\n', 'erybody Loves Saturday Night’. Those who spoke a language others didn’t speak \n', 'would sing the chorus in their mother tongue.” One by one, the chorus was belted \n', 'out in French, German, Spanish, Yiddish, and a variety of African dialects- -a \n', 'rich diversity of accents, indigenous languages, in voices from around the world. \n', 'Everyone was encouraged to repeat the words back in their same language, which \n', 'created an exciting exchange of cultures. “In that moment, I really felt included,” \n', 'says Jonah. “I began to see the beauty in people who are different. But mainly, I \n', 'lost my fear, and that allowed for real human connection.”\n', 'When Jonah got back to high school, he made it a point to learn everyone’s \n', 'first and last name – particularly those students he thought might be feeling os-\n', 'tracized, much in the way he had felt before his camp experience. It was his first \n', 'foray into a personal type of activism, in the tried-and-true practice of Radical \n', 'Inclusion. Now, twenty years later, he’s still stewarding support for global youth \n', 'leaders.\n', 'In 2000 Jonah founded the Global Youth Action Network (GYAN) to con-\n', ' 320\n', 'nect, support, and empower youth globally. GYAN was formed with multiple \n', 'aims in mind: to increase youth participation in decision making; to facilitate \n', 'international collaboration of youth organizations; and to create a structure of \n', 'support from established leaders in social entrepreneurship. With the support he \n', 'has gotten from corporations, institutions, and governments, Jonah has helped to \n', 'amplify the voice of youth in the policy and decision-making processes in more \n', 'than 180 countries around the world. In 2001 GYAN merged with TakingIT-\n', 'Global, a network of several thousand youth NGOs whose online platform is \n', 'visited by thousands of people every day.\n', 'In 2011 Jonah went on to found NEXUS, a global network of influential \n', 'philanthropists and social entrepreneurs who are tackling a wide array of social \n', 'causes and issues, including disaster relief and humanitarian aid, especially in the \n', 'regions most affected by climate change.\n', 'For example, in August 2019, Hurricane Dorian tore through the Grand \n', 'Bahamas. A Category 5 hurricane with winds reaching 185 mph, Dorian caused \n', 'nearly $3.5 billion in damage to this island nation. Nearly 70,000 people were \n', 'left homeless in its wake, with nowhere to go, and local transportation and food \n', 'supplies were devastated. NEXUS quickly responded to Grand Bahama Port Au-\n', 'thority’s Director Rupert Hayward’s call for assistance; they reached out to their \n', 'network of philanthropists to provide a lifeline of supplies. In the end, NEXUS \n', 'members donated 19 planes, more than 50 boats, and nearly $2 million of aid for \n', 'relief efforts.\n', 'At the forefront of NEXUS’s climate-related work is their support for inno-\n', 'vation in the environmental and renewable energy spaces. NEXUS member Sam \n', 'Teicher’s organization Coral Vita is helping to rebuild damaged and vulnerable \n', 'coral reefs around the world. With 30 percent of the world’s coral reefs already \n', 'gone, and 75 percent of what remains forecast to be lost by 2050, organizations \n', 'like Coral Vita are needed now more than ever. Coral reefs are essential for main-\n', 'taining the ocean’s ecosystem. They provide a home for an astonishing 25 percent \n', 'of the biodiversity we see in marine life. They act as protective barriers for main-\n', 'land areas, by absorbing wave shocks. And when they are intact, they can serve as \n', 'lucrative destinations for ecotourism.\n', 'Using an innovative technique called micro-fragmenting, scientists at Coral \n', 'Vita have been able to create growth in coral restoration “farms” in a span of 6-12 \n', 'months, a process that would normally take 25-30 years in the ocean. While this \n', 'has incredible implications for reef recovery, it will still be an uphill battle. As the \n', 'farms grow, the scientists invite people to visit them, so they have an opportunity \n', '321\n', 'to teach the next generation of scientists and conservationists about the impor-\n', 'tance of innovation and social entrepreneurship.\n', 'Through the NEXUS Impact Accelerator program, Jonah is striving to get \n', 'resources directly to those social entrepreneurs who are working on the most crit-\n', 'ical global environmental challenges. An inaugural fellow in this program, Blayne \n', 'Ross, is CEO of Shorelock, a company working to protect vulnerable coastlines \n', 'around the world. Shorelock helps sandy beaches, shorelines, and coastlines resist \n', 'erosion by wave action, winds, storms, and other natural phenomena. By applying \n', 'a powdered mix of a sustainable bonding agent to sand, it creates a microlayer \n', 'of water that helps waves run off the shore without bringing the sand along with \n', 'them. This technology has been proven to be 100 percent environmentally sound, \n', 'and has even helped restore the breeding habitats for certain rare species like sea \n', 'turtles. Shorelock works with the Small Islands Resiliency Program in the Baha-\n', 'mas to protect the coastal lands of indigenous communities, while ensuring that \n', 'the vital islands’ infrastructures, which have been severely impacted by climate \n', 'change, remain intact.\n', 'Galvanizing support for innovation in combating plastics pollution is also \n', 'critical for Jonah. The SUpR Initiative, launched by NEXUS in 2020 in partner-\n', 'ship with Oceanic Global and Accenture, works with professional sports teams \n', 'to reduce and eliminate single use plastics in stadiums.

As a budding journalist in the early 2010’s, he had the rare opportu-\n', 'nity to be a witness to history in the making with the Arab Spring. When David \n', 'embarked on a journey to the Middle East he was on the ground for critical \n', 'moments as they were happening in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Lebanon, Syria, and \n', 'Bahrain.\n', 'These six countries were desperately seeking relief from poverty, as well as \n', 'freedom from the oppressive, corrupt regimes. Uprisings, antigovernment protests, \n', 'and rebellions were spreading across the Arab world. David knew this assignment \n', 'would require some grit, and would even mean facing some danger, in order to be \n', 'on the ground where change was really happening.\n', 'Among the many stories David wrote, one touched him deeply, beyond the \n', 'complicated geopolitics of the moment. He was assigned to write a “puff piece” \n', 'on the Egyptian cotton industry, known as the finest, most luxurious cotton in \n', 'the world. At first, it seemed like an unimportant story – a page-filler that on the \n', 'surface seemed unlike the kind of political story he usually sought out. But as he \n', 'began his research, he learned about the harmful industrial agricultural practices \n', 'that were being used in the Egyptian cotton industry, and the devastating toll these \n', 'practices were having on the health of the farmers. This discovery changed the \n', 'trajectory of David’s professional life almost immediately.\n', 'It’s well known that the gas and oil industries are contributing to our current \n', 'environmental crisis, but with cotton, there is no apparent evidence of pollution—\n', 'no puffs of smoke coming from exhaust pipes that we can easily see or smell. And \n', 'yet, “75 percent of the farmers I spoke with had cancer from the incredibly toxic \n', 'pesticides being used,” says David. “As I dug into the story more, I discovered that \n', 'cotton was the second dirtiest industry in the world, right after oil and gas.”\n', '331\n', 'Cotton is a crop grown from the earth like any vegetable or fruit, and it \n', 'has all of the dangerous pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and other \n', 'chemicals used in the agricultural production process. But it is not simply harvest-\n', 'ed and then sent to stores to be consumed, like tomatoes or carrots. Cotton also \n', 'has a massive manufacturing footprint, processes during which dyes, solvents, and \n', 'all other kinds of chemical treatments are used, which can make it particularly \n', 'toxic. Some estimates state that the average T-shirt has more than 40 kinds of \n', 'chemicals that the FDA considers harmful – and these chemicals have been found \n', 'in alarming numbers in the breast-milk of new mothers around the world.\n', '“When I saw the toll this process was taking on human lives, and on the envi-\n', 'ronment; and that it was being ignored by everyone else in the region, I realized I \n', 'didn’t just want to report on this urgent story,” says David. “I really wanted to do \n', 'something about it.

In Egypt, in 2019, there were roughly 350,000 bales of \n', 'cotton produced, each of which contains 480 pounds of cotton.\n', 'David’s first article about the cotton industry caused quite a stir.

Mostly, they reached out to thank him for \n', 'highlighting this issue. Frequently, they wanted to spread the word about business-\n', 'es in the fashion industry that were using ethically and environmentally conscious \n', 'practices.\n', 'For his next adventure, David decided to build a socially conscious company. \n', 'So he returned home to the U.S. and started his first company, Modavanti, an \n', 'online boutique for ethical fashion brands. “My Mom was happy I was coming \n', 'home, since the Middle East was dangerous,” David says. “However, when I told \n', 'her I was planning to start a fashion company, she was pretty confused. I’d never \n', 'been into fashion. And in the beginning, I really didn’t know anything about fash-\n', 'ion. In fact, I was known for my rumpled journalist look,” he says with a laugh.\n', 'To David, it didn’t matter what industry he worked in, or what people \n', 'thought about his new venture. What mattered to him was that he could create a \n', 'mission-driven company, one that would tell the story of entrepreneurs that are \n', 'running businesses the right way.\n', 'After receiving a massive amount of support from ethical fashion companies \n', ' 332\n', 'around the world, he was invited to speak at the United Nations about the need \n', 'for sustainable fashion. “Through this process, I really learned about the power \n', 'of community,” he says. “I learned that if you share your story, and you live with \n', 'passion and conviction, people will come along for the ride with you.”\n', 'For six years, David grew Modavanti; then he sold it because he wanted to \n', 'expand his social entrepreneurship ventures. “I, and so many others, feel the need \n', 'to push the boundaries and keep going,” he says. “We must never get complacent \n', 'with what we’ve accomplished. So many challenges lay ahead of us.

There was no real reason for Anderson to \n', 'risk his position at the top, and he hadn’t intended to—until that question from \n', 'a conscientious customer came to his attention, and caused him to think again.\n', 'Ray Anderson prided himself on being a thoughtful and intellectually curi-\n', 'ous man. He knew it was what had allowed him to have such success in business. \n', 'So when it came time to look for a better answer to the customer’s challenging \n', 'question, he approached it with that self-same curiosity.

Living just outside of Los Angeles, she \n', 'remembers the air pollution that often lingered over the city. “The smog was so \n', 'bad that on many days, we couldn’t play sports outside after school. I’d go home \n', 'and have to stay inside, and I remember my parents saying that it was so harmful, \n', 'wondering if we should move away. Living near the ocean, plastic pollution was \n', 'also on the top of my mind.”\n', 'When she was just 32 years old, Hillary’s world came to a screeching halt \n', 'when she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. “I was perplexed, because I had al-\n', 'ways gone to great lengths to live a healthy lifestyle. I ate organic foods, meditated, \n', 'spent my free time in nature and at the ocean.” As a young mother of twins, she \n', 'was desperate to discover what could have led to her health crisis so that she could \n', 'protect her children. “I was so concerned,” she says. “I knew that if this could \n', 'happen to me, it could happen to anyone.” Thinking back to her own childhood, \n', 'she began to wonder if her unhealthy environment had contributed to her disease.\n', 'Hillary was shocked to hear on an NPR radio program about a study by \n', 'the Environmental Working Group that had found that toxic chemicals found in \n', 'women’s personal care products were being found in their babies’ blood. “When \n', 'I researched endocrine-disrupting chemicals, I discovered they were in all of the \n', 'products I was buying to look and feel beautiful. How could the beauty industry \n', 'be selling products with these toxins in them to the people they are claiming to \n', '343\n', 'want to help look and feel better?”\n', 'With a sense of both indignance and determination, Hillary embarked on a \n', 'mission to fill the gap that the industry was so callously ignoring. That is how, and \n', 'why, she began True Botanicals—a non-toxic beauty enterprise “to give people \n', 'the chance to look and feel better because they were using a product that was \n', 'actually making their skin healthier.” With Hillary’s rigorous dedication to using \n', 'non-toxic ingredients and employing sustainable business practices, True Botan-\n', 'icals quickly became a guidepost for the cosmetics industry. Because of her un-\n', 'flinching standards, she has gained the support of a wide range of environmental \n', 'advocates and celebrities like Laura Dern and Olivia Wilde.\n', '“When I opened up my email to see a message from Laura Dern, I was \n', 'floored!” Hillary says. “She loves our products, and our story, and what we stand \n', 'for.” As it turns out, Laura grew up near Hillary: she too had experienced the \n', 'smog and other kinds of pollution and saw how they were impacting children’s \n', 'health. This is the reason she has always used her platform to lead on important \n', 'environmental issues. “It really matters to have people with a reach stand up for \n', 'causes that empower a sustainable future,” Hillary says. “Laura has helped ex-\n', 'pand the reach of True Botanicals with all the dynamism I could’ve expected, and \n', 'more.”\n', 'For Laura Dern, the issues a leader and her company embody are just as \n', 'important as the integrity of the product itself. “It’s one thing for me to support \n', 'this sustainable company as a customer, but it’s another thing to then meet Hillary, \n', 'and discover the origin story of the company, and the passion that comes with \n', 'wanting to make products that are good for you, good for your children, good for \n', 'the planet—and to care deeply about it. I was interested in continuing the story,” \n', 'Laura says. “As women, and as activists, we’re working to show people that you \n', 'can use your voice to be true, to live with an authentic story and not hide behind \n', 'shame—which is a perfect parallel to wanting to serve people with a company. \n', 'What we’re all doing is leading with the truth.”\n', 'Hillary credits the flourishing of True Botanicals to the authenticity of \n', 'their people, process, and products, which she constantly puts to the test. Every \n', 'product at True Botanicals is certified by Made Safe® certified, a nonprofit that \n', 'screens products against a list of harmful chemical ingredients like behavioral, \n', 'developmental, reproductive, and neuro toxins; carcinogens, endocrine disrup-\n', 'tors, fire retardants, heavy metals, pesticides, toxic solvents, and harmful volatile \n', 'organic compounds (VOCs). True Botanicals has the distinction of being the first \n', 'entire cosmetic line of products to have the Made Safe® certification. Hillary is \n', ' 344\n', 'proud that her company is also Leaping Bunny certified, the gold standard for  \n', 'cruelty-free, non-animal testing in all stages of its product development.\n', 'Sourcing sustainable ingredients is another important guiding principal for \n', 'Hillary, and to achieve this she works with a large network of entrepreneurs with \n', 'a similar worldview, who lift one another up through collaboration and education. \n', '“Whether it’s Birdsong Herb Farm from Vermont, and their organic calendula, \n', 'or Hudson Hemp from New York, and the oils from their regenerative farm, we \n', 'source from a healthy, organic, regenerative cycle, and our products reflect that \n', 'ethos. This is how you build communities. By supporting the businesses out there \n', 'that are doing the right thing, and educating those that want to join. There are \n', 'more than you might think. I urge everybody to pitch in. It all makes a difference.”\n', 'Hillary hopes True Botanicals can continue to influence leaders in the cos-\n', 'metics industry, as other sustainable pioneers have done in their industries. She \n', 'draws inspiration from leaders like Zach Bush of Farmer’s Footprint, who works \n', 'to spread awareness of regenerative farming practices. “Zach says he is not con-\n', 'cerned about fixing conventional farming, because it’s a dinosaur going by the \n', 'wayside,” she says. “Regenerative farming is the movement of the future, and \n', 'that’s where he can make an impact, so that’s what he is doing. At True Botanicals, \n', 'we are about showing a better way forward and how it can be done profitably. \n', 'That is our important work. If conventional beauty product companies don’t \n', 'want to be obsolete, over time they will have to adapt to what we are doing.”\n', 'What makes Hillary so sure that her stance is sound is the demand for just \n', 'and sustainable cosmetics from consumers themselves. “Our industry has a term \n', 'for our highly educated consumer base: ‘skintellectuals’,” she says. “With such \n', 'widescale concern about the health and safety of the cosmetics we use, there is \n', 'no question that in the coming years, eventually ‘clean’ will be the new standard \n', 'across the board.

Every bit of good helps.”\n', 'For youth who are interested in building a more sustainable future, Hillary \n', 'knows the task at hand is a mighty one. “When you look at climate change, there \n', 'are so many issues of great importance that face us today.

There he picked up his old pas-\n', 'sion. “Mostly I was making pottery with them,” he remembers.\n', 'At about the same time, Ben and his old friend Jerry were making big plans. \n', 'At first, they talked about starting a bagel business. Luckily for the world, the \n', 'equipment needed for a bagel shop was far too expensive. So a new idea took \n', 'shape: what about opening an ice cream business?\n', 'As he and Jerry were exploring this idea, Ben added a new activity to the \n', 'curriculum at his school. “We started making ice cream together,” he says. “I \n', 'made a few batches with the kids; it was kind of an extracurricular thing.”\n', 'Ben and Jerry realized that for their ice cream shop to be successful they \n', 'should find a town with warm weather and college students. “But all the warm \n', 'places already had homemade ice cream parlors,” Ben says. “So we decided we’d \n', 'go all the way up to Burlington, Vermont.” They started their business in their \n', 'garage, and they distinguished their brand by giving their flavors hip names and \n', 'including extra-large chunks in the ice cream.\n', '347\n', 'And their ice cream was a hit—soon everyone in Burlington had heard \n', 'about it, and wanted to buy it.\n', 'That was great, but as the company grew, Ben became increasingly aware \n', 'of the environmental and social impact their company was having on their com-\n', 'munity. Social justice issues had been on Ben’s mind since an encounter with the \n', 'police he had in his college years.

80,Lara and Claire Nuer,Learning As Leadership: Humanizing Business,350,355,"['Humanizing Business\n', 'Lara & Claire Nuer | California / France\n', 'Lara Nuer was an ordinary teenager living in Paris with her family. She \n', 'applied herself in school, had a close network of friends, and got along with her \n', 'younger brother. Behind the appearances, however, Lara was resentful. “I was in \n', 'the throes of a teenage crisis. I was easily annoyed by anything my mother said \n', 'and felt oppressed by her sense of responsibility and sacrifice. I was on the shy and \n', 'introverted side, so most of my rebellion was internal rather than voiced. But she \n', 'knew it, and it hurt her.”\n', 'Then, one day, everything changed in an instant. Lara’s mother Claire was \n', 'diagnosed with a terminal cancer and given three months to live. “When this hap-\n', ' 350\n', 'pened, my teenage crises vanished overnight,” Lara says. “I immediately became \n', 'determined to help her conquer this cancer. It was a very pure, naïve sense of \n', 'hope and possibility. I was only 14, but I was on a mission to keep her alive. My \n', 'father and I became her copilots on her quest for healing.”\n', 'Claire knew what it was like to lose a parent. When she was nine years old, \n', 'her father had been deported to Auschwitz, never to return. When Claire was \n', 'only seven, she had been sent into hiding, away from her parents. She had faced \n', 'hunger, abuse, and disease during the dark years of the Holocaust. Now she fero-\n', 'ciously wanted to see her children grow up – and to be there for them.\n', 'Her type of cancer was very rare and there were no treatments for it at that \n', 'time. But with her husband Sam’s, and Lara’s help, she became determined to \n', 'try anything, look anywhere, even in the most unconventional places, for healing.\n', 'One of those places was inside herself. Claire and Sam became obsessed with \n', 'this thought: “If we only have a few months left, how can we make the most out \n', 'of them, in our relationships with each other, our kids, our community?” This \n', 'propelled them into an adventure of self-discovery, as they learned how to “show \n', 'up as their best selves” with their family, since time was now so precious.\n', 'They devoured self-improvement books, travelled the world looking for the \n', 'latest medical treatments, and in the process met pioneers in the field of human \n', 'potential of the 1970s and 80’s in the U.S., like Gerald Jampolsky and Dr. Carl \n', 'Simonton.\n', 'They slowly became more conscious of all the internal barriers people cre-\n', 'ate instead of living each moment in joy, aligned with a sense of purpose. A big \n', 'one, they came to discover, is the underlying fears and insecurities that stem from \n', 'painful experiences in our childhoods. Claire realized that as a “hidden child” she \n', 'had developed fears of being excluded, abandoned and betrayed. That led her to \n', 'lose her temper when she perceived someone was not keeping a promise, or didn’t \n', 'tell her the whole truth.\n', 'Through these new insights - while she was still battling her cancer—Claire’s \n', 'life’s work was born: to give people the tools to discover this kind of self-awareness \n', 'back to the world. Claire and Sam created workshops to help others to bring their \n', 'best selves to their projects and their relationships. “Don’t wait until you have a \n', 'few months to live to work on yourself!” was her motto.\n', 'Awareness of one’s own fears, the origins of those fears, and their impact on \n', 'behavior are at the core of the educational seminars that Claire developed over \n', 'time—with Sam, and a growing number of volunteers. Reflecting back to these \n', 'early days, “I was fascinated by how this work was allowing people to transform \n', '351\n', 'their lives, helping them become more who they wanted to be. It was very em-\n', 'powering.”\n', 'From the very beginning, Lara attended every seminar she could. She too \n', 'was eager to work on her own issues of shyness and her defensiveness. “I’d com-\n', 'plained about how my mother always needed to be right,” she says. “Turns out I \n', 'had my own need to be right!”\n', '“Like my mother, I was convinced that if people could learn to bring their \n', 'best selves to their relationships, their work, their lives, that this would curb their \n', 'need to demonize the ‘Other’,” she says. “Ultimately, we hoped we could prevent \n', 'another Auschwitz.”\n', 'So now Lara was on a mission, not only to keep her mother alive, but to \n', 'spread this work. Her friends in school, her boyfriends, her teachers, her boss and \n', 'her manager in the marketing department of Evian: “They all attended, drawn \n', 'by my enthusiasm,” she says. “They were all transformed.”\n', 'After graduating from high school, Lara attended one of the top business \n', 'schools in France. “I saw how teams, though wanting to innovate and create great \n', 'things, ended up in ‘us vs. them’ dynamics, ‘I have to win over you’ mentalities, \n', 'and turf wars.”\n', '“After I graduated from college, I felt a calling,” Lara says. “I didn’t want \n', 'to climb the corporate ladder of a major company; I wanted to help spread this \n', 'work to the business community. Because if the business leaders can work on \n', 'themselves, then we will really change the world, one ego at a time!”\n', 'It was then that Lara decided to join Claire’s organization full time, where \n', 'she was in charge of outreach to executive leaders. The programs continued to de-\n', 'velop, infused by encounters with pioneers in related fields, like Dr. Maxie Mault-\n', 'by, the founder of Rational Behavior Theory, and Peter Senge, the co-founder of \n', 'Learning Organizations, and author of The Fifth Discipline.\n', 'Claire was now being invited to speak at major conferences and offer her \n', 'programs in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

Leaders like Deepak Chopra, Willis Harmon, and George McCown \n', 'wanted to meet her.

81,François van den Abeele,Sea2See Eyewear,355,358,"['Sustainable Products With A Conscience\n', 'François van den Abeele | Spain\n', 'François van den Abeele’s idea for cleaning up plastic in the oceans emerged \n', 'over time. As a journalist, he’d covered social and environmental issues in over \n', '130 countries in some of the world’s most vulnerable regions, like Sub-Saharan \n', 'Africa and the Middle East. From what he’d seen, the crisis of plastic pollution in \n', 'the waterways was devastating impoverished communities, and the scale of the \n', 'neglect was monumental. Francois was troubled and often thought about this \n', 'problem—and about what could be done.\n', '“You don’t just get out of bed one day and say, ‘I want to manufacture eye-\n', 'glasses out of plastic waste’” he says. “I started to wear glasses later in life, so \n', 'by then they were more on my mind.” One day he thought, “Hey, glasses are \n', 'something people all over the world wear. Frames are made of plastic. Then the \n', 'gears began turning.”\n', 'While Francois had no experience in fashion, he was a quick study. He dis-\n', 'covered that fashion is a $100 billion a year industry, and that it is among the \n', 'most environmentally damaging, ranking only behind oil and gas in terms of its \n', 'negative impact. His vision was ambitious, but it was not unrealistic. He’d worked \n', 'with impact businesses before. “I soon realized that this was a way to create a \n', 'sustainable product that was profitable, and that could help clean up the oceans.”\n', 'In 2016, he put together a team, gathered up 20 kilos of recycled plastic, \n', 'brought it to a processor in Italy, and made Sea2See’s first run of products—20 \n', 'sunglasses. “It was a big idea and there were a lot of skeptics. Even my wife \n', 'thought it was a crazy idea, using marine waste for frames. But there they were.”\n', 'The product was a hit almost immediately. To keep up with growing de-\n', 'mand, Francois began working with fishermen in Spain to gather plastic. He then \n', 'expanded his operation to France. Now he works with African fishing communi-\n', 'ties in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo, and he is hoping to expand to other African \n', '355\n', 'countries as well. Together they clean up polluted waterways while providing a \n', 'much-needed revenue stream for these once marginalized fishermen. “When I \n', 'first went there, they thought I was crazy,” he says. “They wondered why this guy \n', 'was going to pay them for collecting waste.” To his critics, François responded, \n', '“Waste has value. And cleaning it up has a value too—it benefits everyone.”\n', 'Over time François has leveraged the power of this new community of fish-\n', 'ermen to address other regional problems. With the excess plastic that remains \n', 'after the frame-making process, he launched a line of watches that supports the \n', 'nonprofit organization Free the Slaves, to stop child exploitation in places like \n', 'Lake Volta in Ghana, where children are forced to work. “The sale of one watch \n', 'finances two weeks of education for each kid that is saved. Our campaign is called \n', 'Time for Time, because we all have time; and I believe we should give meaning \n', 'to our time by giving back to the most vulnerable among us.” And not all of the \n', 'waste collected by Sea2See goes into glasses or watches: they are also building a \n', 'recycling plant, to provide recycled plastic for industries looking for it.\n', 'In 2017, François took his growing business to Chivas Venture, whose in-\n', 'ternational contest invests in social entrepreneurs with start-up projects. Sea2See \n', 'won Best Start-Up in the 2nd edition of the contest in Spain and went on to the \n', 'finals in Los Angeles. While Sea2See did not receive the gold medal, in a tough \n', 'field of sustainable innovators, Francois did receive a call some months later that \n', 'made his intercontinental trip worthwhile.\n', 'When Spanish movie star Javier Bardem saw Sea2See glasses at the contest \n', 'in Los Angeles, he was so inspired that he asked if he could join François and \n', 'his fishermen for a day on the water. He wanted to bring his film crew along, so \n', 'they could raise awareness about the problem of plastic pollution in the ocean \n', 'and showcase Sea2See’s successful venture. “When Javier came out on the fishing \n', 'boat to support us, it really was a boost. He genuinely wants to use his voice to \n', 'help make a change, and he really did,” Francois says. Together, François and \n', 'Javier created a film campaign that has raised awareness about the dangers that \n', 'single-use plastic straws pose to marine life.\n', 'To thank him for his generous support, François gave Javier a pair of Sea-\n', '2See frames. A few days later, at the Cannes Film Festival, Javier’s wife Penelope \n', 'Cruz wore the frames to a film premier, and Hola, one of the biggest celebrity \n', 'magazines in Spain, featured a signature photograph of her wearing her Sea2See \n', 'frames on their cover. “It’s great that we got that exposure,” François says. “I really \n', 'hope more influential people with a platform decide to take up this cause.”\n', 'As of March 2021, Sea2See had collected 443 tons of plastic for its glasses, \n', ' 356\n', 'all while adhering to the strictest standards of the Cradle to Cradle certified prod-\n', 'ucts program. This program is the benchmark by which sustainable businesses \n', 'are measured, particularly as it pertains to the circular economy. Sea2See has \n', 'received the Platinum distinction in material health, and the Gold certification \n', 'overall, meaning it has achieved excellence in each of the five categories: material \n', 'health, circular economy, renewable energy, water stewardship, and social fairness. \n', 'Francois is very proud of these distinctions. “It proves the purity of our recycled \n', 'raw material,” he says.\n', '“We are proving that there is another way,” he says. “By now, most people \n', 'understand that the linear model of business just doesn’t work. That’s why we \n', 'bring a cyclical point of view to plastic waste cleanup. We are the only business \n', 'that is vertically integrated all the way from waste collection to the final product. \n', 'We hope we can inspire others to do more of the same. It’s important, because \n', 'by giving value to waste, we have an environmental impact on the coastal envi-\n', 'ronment but also a social impact, thanks to the new source of income the waste \n', 'collectors have.”\n', 'And François has in fact succeeded in inspiring others: for example, he was \n', 'invited by sustainability experts in Brussels to speak at a conference on SIDS \n', '(Small Island Developing States), where he met diplomats who were intrigued by \n', 'Sea2See. He was then invited to attend the United Nations World Ocean Confer-\n', 'ence in New York. “When I got there, I was talking with the Minister of Foreign \n', 'Affairs of Brussels, who shocked me by saying, ‘I know you.’ At first I thought \n', 'he must be mistaken.” But then the Minister pulled out his papers and showed \n', 'François how he had written about Sea2See in his remarks. “I am going to talk \n', 'about you at the Assembly today,” he said. “We need to help start-ups that are \n', 'raising the issue of ocean contamination and reusing plastic waste.”\n', 'At the conference, Sea2See was showcased as an example of how to reduce \n', 'marine contamination while creating value for consumers worldwide. “I was \n', 'thrilled to see people catching on to the idea of a circular economy—especially \n', 'those who were advocating for it so passionately. It gave me a lot of hope for \n', 'what’s to come.”\n', 'François believes that the future of all business must become sustainable \n', 'business, and this is where the youth can really lead the charge. “If you want to \n', 'start any type of business, it’s my belief that it should have an impact beyond \n', 'whatever product or service you are offering. There are so many things you can \n', 'do. I know it’s tricky. It takes time. But if you have the resolve, you can do it. Try to \n', 'have an impact. That’s what I’ve tried to do.

He went hiking and ski-racing, breathing in the cold, fresh air \n', 'and feeling the warm sunlight on his face. He especially enjoyed the breathtaking \n', 'view from the mountain top: on clear days he could even see the Atlantic Ocean \n', 'far off in the distance.\n', 'When he was in college, and he returned to the summit of the mountain he \n', 'knew so well, he noticed a big change. “You couldn’t see the ocean anymore,” he \n', 'says. The change was for a well-known reason. “Air pollution and atmospheric \n', 'changes from climate change.”\n', 'As a child, the importance of giving back to others had been deeply ingrained \n', ' 358\n', 'in him by his mother. “She lived by that example,” Gary says. “She worked in \n', 'soup kitchens, volunteered for presidential candidates, helped at the local hospital, \n', 'or at the Boys and Girls Clubs,” Gary says. He pauses, remembering. “I can’t \n', 'remember a dinnertime conversation where my mother wasn’t saying that it’s up \n', 'to us to give back.”\n', 'Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was another big influence on Gary. The King \n', 'family were friends of Gary’s family, and when Coretta Scott King and her chil-\n', 'dren visited the Hirshberg’s vacation home, Gary spent a lot of time with them, \n', 'just hanging out, talking over meals, listening to Coretta. Then, in 1968 Dr. King \n', 'was assassinated. “I was just 14 at the time, so it really became cemented in me, \n', 'that service wasn’t an option. Service was just what you did.”\n', 'When Gary was in college, he worked in an environmental education camp \n', 'for high school students in Maine. He and his fellow camp guides were responsible \n', 'for managing 26,000 acres of wildlife refuge, and teaching students about the \n', 'importance of environmental preservation. But sadly, all around this amazing \n', 'forest, they could see that the timber industry was cutting down trees.\n', '“While we were putting our hearts and souls into wildlife and conservation, \n', 'all around us we could see these clear cuts, with herbicides and everything else,” \n', 'he says. “The refuge was surrounded by about a million acres of pulp and paper \n', 'land. I got the message that ‘This is bad. We need to work on alternatives.’”\n', 'Coming up with ideas for viable, more sustainable alternatives was some-\n', 'thing Gary had to do often at the family dinner table. His grandfather was a \n', 'successful banker with rather conservative views. “More often than not he would \n', 'slay me with some economic argument; I really didn’t have the answers then,” \n', 'Gary says. “But I learned that business is where all the polluting happens, and \n', 'that while business wasn’t the only problem, it was very definitely not part of the \n', 'solution. So I was really seeking alternatives.”\n', 'Gary understood that if there was going to be change, it needed to come \n', 'from within the business community; and it needed to come in the form of viable \n', 'alternatives. So when he was 23, he joined the think tank New Alchemy and \n', 'immersed himself in the emerging renewable energy industry of wind power.\n', 'New Alchemy was a small start-up: it needed lots of investments to get off \n', 'the ground. Fortunately, very quickly Gary discovered that he was a gifted fund-\n', 'raiser. Within two years, at the age of 25, he became the executive director of the \n', 'company.\n', 'Gary put his fundraising skills to good use for a small organic farming \n', 'school, the Rural Education Center in Wilton, New Hampshire. It wasn’t easy. \n', '359\n', 'In the1980s public funding for environmental projects had dried up under a new \n', 'administration, and competition for the little funding that was available was fierce.\n', 'Gary enjoyed the fringe benefits from the school’s farm. “My partner was \n', 'producing this incredibly delicious, wonderful yogurt, which we would sit around \n', 'eating,” Gary remembers. “And then one day somebody—we’re still not sure who \n', 'it was—said, why don’t we start selling this yogurt?”\n', 'That was the beginning of Stonyfield Farm, which would become the \n', 'world’s leading producer of organic yogurt under Gary’s leadership.\n', 'Turning Stonyfield from the little farming school it was initially into the na-\n', 'tional organic yogurt company it is today, took a lot of hard work and dedication. \n', 'They started out by selling their yogurt at only five stores.\n', '“Night after night, even after milking and after making yogurt, one of us—\n', 'whoever wasn’t milking—would go and do a demo at the store,” Gary remembers. \n', '“We would stand there, and we’d talk to consumers, and we’d simply not let them \n', 'say no.”\n', 'Soon, they were able to sell their yogurt in 10 nearby stores, then in 35. \n', 'Eventually, they were the third largest brand in all of their stores. From the very \n', 'beginning, Gary and his business partner, Samuel, used the packaging of their \n', 'products to educate customers. “It was very simply our way of being able to tell \n', 'our story,” Gary says. “The early packages were like mini lessons in where peo-\n', 'ple’s food comes from.”\n', 'As their brand grew into a real company, Gary and his colleagues at Stony-\n', 'field Farm started using their profits to support all kinds of special projects. Early \n', 'on they decided that 10 percent of their profits would be spent on initiatives to \n', 'fight against climate change. Since then, the company has spearheaded many \n', 'measures to minimize its carbon footprint and to support environmental efforts. \n', 'Some of Stonyfield’s newest initiatives include the OpenTEAM project, the \n', 'StonyFIELDS #playfree initiative, and a new goal of reducing carbon emissions \n', 'by 30 percent by 2030.\n', 'As CEO of Stonyfield, it was important to Gary to incorporate the values \n', 'that had been instilled in him during his childhood – and to reconcile his entre-\n', 'preneurial spirit with service to his community. “I realized that we needed a real \n', 'strategy, an economic strategy,” he says. “Creating an actual economic enterprise \n', 'whose mission is to save family farmers, and try to slow down the urbanization of \n', 'rural land, providing healthy food, all of that: it was very appealing.”\n', 'Gary used every imaginative way he could think of to educate the public \n', ' 360\n', 'about sustainable farming.\n', 'In 1989, the company introduced the Have-a-Cow Educational program, \n', 'through which customers were invited to “adopt” one of the Stonyfield cows. \n', 'Then they would receive regular updates about the cows they had adopted, along \n', 'with information about the issues that small-scale farmers were facing.\n', 'But Gary and his team realized that it wasn’t only the public that needed to \n', 'be educated—farmers, too, needed information and training on how to run their \n', 'farms sustainably. Stonyfield also noticed that the population of organic dairy \n', 'farmers in this region was aging. More and more farmers were getting close to \n', 'the age of retirement with no plans for who would take over the farm when they \n', 'retired. So in 2015 Stonyfield partnered with Wolfe’s Neck Center for Agricul-\n', 'ture and the Environment to establish a first-of-its-kind residential organic dairy \n', 'training program where the younger generation of farmers could learn about \n', 'regenerative farming practices in a two-year apprenticeship program. Addition-\n', 'ally, over time, starting in 2014, Stonyfield built up a network of direct supply \n', 'organic dairy farmers, and they were able to start supplementing their milk supply \n', 'with milk from other local organic farmers. So, first they supplied local farmers \n', 'with the skills and technical assistance they needed to make their businesses grow \n', 'sustainably: then they bought their milk. It was a win-win situation.\n', 'With his hard work and dedication, Gary has managed to grow Stonyfield \n', 'Farms into a national enterprise that is also giving back to the local community—\n', 'just like he had learned to do from his mother and his childhood friends.\n', '“I always say to folks that determination is the most important and underap-\n', 'preciated characteristic needed to be an entrepreneur,” he says. “Nothing takes \n', 'the place of hard work and passion.”\n', 'It really boils down to this: that all life is interrelated. \n', 'We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality,\n', ' tied into a single garment of destiny. \n', 'Whatever affects one destiny, affects all indirectly.\n', 'Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n', '361\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Find the nearest local farmer’s market to your home—it’s fresh food, \n', 'locally produced, and 100% good for the environment. \n', 'Or find a CSA (community supported agriculture) to support: they’ll \n', 'deliver fresh organic food right to your home.\n']","['agriculture sustainable practices', 'climate education sustainable farming', 'community service', 'deforestation Maine', 'food industry sustainable businesses', 'health healthy foods', 'Hirshberg, Gary', 'King Gary Hirshberg and', 'King quotes by', 'New Alchemy', 'New Hampshire', 'organic farming', 'regenerative farming', 'Stonyfield Farm', 'sustainable agriculture', 'sustainable business models food industry', 'sustainable farming', 'yogurt, organic']"

The Philippines is the country that is most \n', 'affected by climate change in the world. More than half of the ten deadliest \n', 'storms that have ever hit the chain of islands have done so in the past decade and \n', 'a half.

84,Ed Begley Jr.,"Sustainable Business, Sustainable Living",366,371,"['Sustainable Living\n', 'Ed Begley Jr. | California\n', 'Ed Begley Jr. was a 20-year-old struggling actor who was deeply impacted by \n', 'the first Earth Day. That historical day, April 22, 1970, launched what would be-\n', 'come a global environmental movement. “I was watching the future being made \n', 'in real time,” Ed reflects. “It was a very humbling experience to be a part of it.”\n', 'It really got him thinking: imagine what the future could look like if the mo-\n', 'mentum from this one-day event was leveraged to make an even broader impact. \n', 'Ed reached out to the leaders who had organized Earth Day, like U.S. Senator \n', 'Gaylord Nelson, and posed a question: “It’s fine to have this one day,” he said. \n', '“But as a movement, and a community, what are we going to do for the other 364 \n', 'days?”\n', 'Many responded with ambitious plans to expand efforts to clean up the land \n', 'and water around the country. “I knew this was important,” Ed says. “I lived in \n', 'smoggy LA, and could see how needed these programs were. So I committed to \n', 'doing my part to live sustainably.” And he has ever since.\n', 'Ed got an impressionable nudge from the man he admired most in the world. \n', '“My father said to me, almost as a challenge, ‘I know what you are against, Eddy. \n', 'The smog. Well - what are you for?’ I knew what he meant. And he was right. I’ll \n', 'never forget those words. My father remains a great inspiration for me.”\n', 'Ed describes his father as “a conservative who liked to conserve.” “Growing \n', 'up, we turned off the lights. Turned off the water. Saved tin foil. We never used \n', ' 366\n', 'the word environmentalism. We just knew this was something we all needed to \n', 'do. I still feel this way. Republican, Democrat, Independent, Green Party. We can \n', 'argue about different things. But I say, let’s all agree on this: Do we want to clean \n', 'up the earth? Put more money in your pockets? Have intact forests and oceans \n', 'for our kids and grandkids? Great. Then we’re all environmentalists! Let’s do it.”\n', 'Ed has lived sustainably for over 50 years, carrying that legacy from the time \n', 'he was a struggling actor to now, when he is a celebrated actor who has starred in \n', 'hundreds of films and TV shows.\n', 'He started small, recycling, composting organic matter, eating vegetarian \n', 'and buying an inexpensive solar vehicle, a Taylor Dunne. “It was great supporting \n', 'a sustainable business,” he says. “And I felt good about driving around Los Ange-\n', 'les and not contributing to the smog.”\n', 'It didn’t take long for Ed to realize that these personal decisions that sup-\n', 'ported sustainable businesses were not only good for the environment, but were \n', 'also cost-effective. “Soon I realized that going green was actually cheaper. It’s the \n', 'same today. It’s still cheaper to plug a car into the wall than to pay at the pump.” \n', 'With his savings, Ed continued to increase his commitment to buying and sup-\n', 'porting sustainable businesses, with a particular affinity for companies that were \n', 'pushing the boundaries in electric vehicle (EV) technology.\n', 'Ed then began experimenting with projects of his own. “I went from that \n', 'Taylor Dunne and bought a used 1973 Subaru for $1750 and converted it to elec-\n', 'tric, which took another $2500. Ultimately, I had a really cheap freeway-worthy \n', 'electric vehicle. That was back in 1990 - and there weren’t many out there at the \n', 'time.” Ed went on to convert a Volkswagen Rabbit to electric. After tinkering \n', 'on his own projects for a time, he decided to trust the business leaders, and went \n', 'back to driving EVs from companies leading the industry. “I leased an EV1 from \n', 'General Motors, which was way ahead of its time. I went on to a Toyota Rav \n', '4, a purely electric vehicle, a precursor to their amazing Prius. Then a Nissan \n', 'Leaf. And now I’m driving a Tesla, which is innovating in ways I could’ve never \n', 'imagined.”\n', 'Ed’s passion led him to dabble in wind energy. “Early on I worked with \n', 'PacWind, which built turbines around 75 kilowatts. From 1985-2015, I owned a \n', 'wind turbine footprint in Palm Springs Desert as part of the Painted Hills Wind \n', 'Energy Repowering Project. Then I transitioned to the Dutch company Zond, \n', 'whose amazing turbines produce around 1.5 megawatts. It took me 20 years of \n', 'saving to be able to afford solar power on my home - and I’ve never looked back. \n', 'There’s a long list of things you can’t do, but there’s a lot longer and more inter-\n', '367\n', 'esting list of the things you can do.”\n', 'Practicing what he preaches has become a whole way of life for Ed, and \n', 'even the subject of a reality TV show, Living with Ed. He is now a big believer \n', 'in the power of education and outreach to raise public awareness of what each \n', 'of us can do to be environmentalists. “It’s why I write books. It’s why I speak to \n', 'young people. I contribute in my small way. What Greta Thunberg is doing—to \n', 'take a sailboat across the Atlantic—I couldn’t do something like that, so I do \n', 'what I can. But thank goodness she is! The way that people young and old are \n', 'responding to her is amazing. She’s inspired me to get out there and do more. A \n', 'lot of us from the earlier generation felt like we were in low gear for a while. She \n', 'got us reinvigorated.”\n', 'Both living and teaching sustainable living is essential for Ed; he knows that \n', 'personal action alone won’t solve this problem. Whether it’s his actions or Greta’s, \n', 'there needs to be an infrastructure supporting this change. “It’s not just about \n', 'me recycling my bottles,” he says. “Legislation and corporate social responsibility \n', '(CSR) are major parts of this equation—three parts of a triangle, really.”\n', 'On the legislative front, Ed points to a long list of environmental crises that \n', 'he’s seen remedied in his lifetime. The Hudson River in New York City was so \n', 'polluted that you couldn’t safely swim in the waters. Now it has burgeoning fish-\n', 'eries thanks to the Clean Water Act. The Cuyahoga River in Northeast Ohio that \n', 'caught fire in 1969 does not catch fire anymore. “Los Angeles gives me hope,” Ed \n', 'says. “Even though there’s four times the number of cars here, and millions more \n', 'people, we have a fraction of the smog today than we did in 1970. This is because \n', 'of the Clean Air Act. That’s a real success story.”\n', 'Ed himself runs a sustainable business, featuring a line of green indoor \n', 'cleaning products called Begley’s Best. His formulas include floor and counter \n', 'cleaners, waterless pet shampoo, dish soap, wrinkle remover, and more. “I wanted \n', 'to show that a business can have a conscience,” he explains. “We can be ethical \n', 'and drive these healthy habits while being profitable at the same time. Look at \n', 'what Jeffrey Hollender has done with Seventh Generation. Take businesses like \n', 'Ben & Jerry’s, or innovators like Ray C. Anderson of Interface. There’s lots of \n', 'people doing well by doing good. And I want to encourage more of it.”\n', 'As is the case with everything Ed does, he lives the change he wants to see \n', 'in the world of sustainable business. Through his family foundation, he gives tens \n', 'of thousands of dollars of profits from Begley’s Best each year to support green \n', 'initiatives he believes in.\n', 'For all of the sustainable business leaders doing great things, Ed wants to \n', ' 368\n', 'make sure they balance their outlook with a sober take on the situation at hand. \n', '“We still have plenty of areas in crisis. Most importantly, we have people from \n', 'low-income communities who are struggling, and they need our help the most. I \n', 'encourage more businesses and individuals to take on these challenges, because \n', 'every bit makes a difference.”\n', 'For young people, who have inherited the climate situation we are in, Ed has \n', 'a candid message, “I’m sorry. I make a sincere apology to those that will come \n', 'after me. We certainly tried. I wish I could have done a better job.”\n', 'With his voice of sage wisdom and experience, he adds, “We need to be \n', 'honest, and we have to accept that there is going to be some continuing loss and \n', 'some damage. But don’t stop because of that. There’s so much left that we can \n', 'save. And Mother Nature is resilient. So, I believe it’s incredibly important to be \n', 'hopeful. We’ve seen what happened with all the doom and gloom. So, let’s remind \n', 'ourselves of the good news from time to time.”\n', 'Ed believes we owe a great debt of gratitude to the current youth envi-\n', 'ronmental leaders who have brought the conversation into the mainstream once \n', 'again. “Thanks to Greta Thunberg and other youth charging us into the future, \n', 'I’m filled with more hope every day. They have challenged us to do everything \n', 'we can, precisely because there is hope. Yes, the situation is dire, but many things \n', 'can be fixed, and made right, and protected.

86,Leila Ndabirabe,A Citizen Of The World,374,378,"['A Citizen Of The World\n', 'Leila Ndabirabe | Burundi / Belgium \n', 'Leila Ndabirabe began to notice that the climate was changing even as she \n', 'was growing up. Few may have heard of the small African country of Burundi. \n', 'But the country, located at the intersection of Africa’s Great Lakes region, the \n', 'plains of East Africa and the Great Rift Valley, has a special place in the continent. \n', 'Burundi is known as the “heart of Africa.”\n', 'It was here that Leila spent the first 10 years of her life. She lived with her \n', 'family in Bujumbura, the largest city and a key port for goods like coffee and ore. \n', 'She remembers the central market and the church her family attended. Every-\n', 'body in her neighborhood knew one another well and there was a strong sense of \n', 'community. Neighbors spoke with neighbors and supported one another.\n', 'However, the drier weather was making it harder to grow crops and people \n', 'were being forced migrate to the cities. “The dry season it getting so dry, it doesn’t \n', 'rain enough, so people don’t have enough food to eat,” she says. “The soil is bad, \n', 'and the pollution is bad. Everybody is moving into the city because they don’t \n', 'have enough food to survive.”\n', 'The increasing lack of food undermined her country’s peaceful coexistence, \n', 'where there was an unsettling feeling of instability that would soon spread across \n', 'the small country. That instability—spurred by a whirlwind of politics, prejudice \n', 'and poverty—eventually erupted in the 1990s, when Leila was just a child. The \n', 'heart of Africa nearly stopped beating, ripped apart by a brutal civil war.\n', 'The Civil War didn’t happen overnight and it didn’t spread to Bujumbura \n', 'immediately. “You would hear gunshots and you knew you weren’t always safe, \n', 'but we kind of got used to it,” she says. “We slept with our clothes on in case we \n', 'had to run in the middle of the night. We just made fun of it. The war was always \n', 'something in the back of our minds.”\n', 'By the time she was 10 years old, in 2000, her parents decided it was no \n', ' 374\n', 'longer safe to live in Burundi. So they moved to Belgium as refugees. Moving to \n', 'a new country, and a new continent, at such a young age wasn’t easy for Leila. \n', 'Even though her new classmates were friendly—she remembers them smiling at \n', 'her and trying to connect with her—it still took her a while to make friends. And \n', 'though she had long dreamt of Europe as a sort of promised land, she learned \n', 'that the reality of it was not that simple.\n', '“When I arrived in Belgium, I had spoken Kirundi my whole life, and learned \n', 'French only at school, but not enough to feel comfortable in a conversation. Plus, I \n', 'was the only black girl in my classroom,” she says. “It’s a lonely moment when you \n', 'realize, oh, wow, you thought it would be a dream, but when you get there, you \n', 'have to overcome a lot of things and learn a new culture, learn a new language,” \n', 'she says. “The temperature is different, the social environment is different, every-\n', 'thing is different.”\n', 'Being a curious child turned out to be her greatest asset that kept her posi-\n', 'tive through this major life change. Keeping an open mind and asking questions \n', 'helped her to get to know this new, unfamiliar environment. “Instead of seeing \n', 'things as a difficulty, you just try to see it’s a good opportunity to learn something \n', 'different,” she says. “Don’t be afraid and don’t stay in your corner. Be open and \n', 'just make the best of each situation.”\n', 'Soon Leila began to become more confident and with confidence came suc-\n', 'cess. She eventually learned several more languages—including French, English, \n', 'Dutch, and Swahili—and she was accepted to law school to pursue her passion \n', 'for social justice.\n', 'All the while, Leila was blossoming into a lovely young woman. At nearly \n', 'six feet tall, with high structured cheekbones and dark eyes, she began to catch \n', 'the attention of modeling agencies, in Belgium and Europe. People told her she \n', 'looked like Naomi Campbell, the British model and entrepreneur.\n', 'At first Leila brushed aside the requests to model. Her mother was reluctant \n', 'for her to start a modeling career. Back home in Burundi, there were strong gen-\n', 'der norms and social mores that prevented girls like her from pursuing modeling. \n', 'It just wasn’t a “thing” for girls like her, she was told. Where her mother saw a \n', 'dead end, Leila saw an opportunity. Not just to lead a successful career, but to \n', 'inspire other girls like her around the world. Eventually, with a little help from her \n', 'sister, she was able to convince her mom to let her give it a try.\n', 'Then her fashion career caught fire. She appeared in shoots for Vogue and \n', 'Harper’s Bazaar among other magazines. This started her on a new journey, to \n', 'NYC where she lives now. “That’s another dream that came true for me,” she says. \n', '375\n', '“But once again I had to start all over by adapting, and learning about the fashion \n', 'industry, with its set of values. That led to building my career; having a voice; and \n', 'becoming the woman I am today: a blend of three cultures—African, European, \n', 'and American.”\n', 'Now, as Burundi’s first top model, she’s walked the runway wearing the \n', 'dresses of some of the most well-known fashion designers: Oscar de la Renta, \n', 'Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Hermes and others. From Fashion Week in Paris, to Milan \n', 'and New York City, her career takes her around the globe, where she’s become, in \n', 'her own words, a “citizen of the world.”\n', 'Her mom has now become her number one fan. “She’s so proud because \n', 'she realized that it’s just a job—no different from any other job,” Leila says. “It’s \n', 'just a different path.”\n', 'Over the years Leila’s life path has inspired young black girls in Belgium, Bu-\n', 'rundi and across the African continent—showing them there is a place for them \n', 'in the modeling world. With a growing influence and platform, she looked for \n', 'ways to be a force for good, helping girls who are struggling to find their way in \n', 'conflict-affected countries like hers.\n', 'Growing up, Leila had seen Marguerite “Maggy” Barankitse on TV sharing \n', 'about her work with Maison Shalom. “In her speeches, she talks about human-\n', 'ity, about forgiveness, about hope,” says Leila. She was touched by how Maggy \n', 'helps orphans gain access to a better future through loving support and education. \n', 'Founded in 1993, Maggy adopted 30 orphans in Burundi during the civil war, \n', 'and has gone on to help thousands more. She won peace prizes and would tour \n', 'European countries and reach out to the Burundi diaspora to raise awareness and \n', 'ask for support. “What she has done is just amazing!” says Leila.\n', 'Inspired by Maggy’s work, Leila began to use her model platform as a force \n', 'for good. She knew that her life could easily have gone this way. Had one of the \n', 'bombs or gunshots she’d heard going off as a child, she or her family could very \n', 'well have been in the line of fire. Five years ago there was another crisis and \n', '300,000 people left the country. Maggy had to flee the country to the neighboring \n', 'country of Rwanda, where she opened another house for Burundi’s refugees.\n', 'In 2018 Leila wrote to Maggy asking how she might help. Since then, she \n', 'has leveraged the power of the media to bring attention to Maison Shalom. She’s \n', 'given interviews bringing light to the crisis in Burundi, and visited a refugee camp \n', 'in Rwanda where she met with some of the young people displaced by the war. “If \n', 'I can be that channel to just open up people and even the young generation, I want \n', 'them to just do something because it’s not something that only the international \n', ' 376\n', 'community can do. It’s like everybody as an individual should do something.”\n', 'Then for Christmas in 2019 Leila visited Maison Shalom’s house in Rwan-\n', 'da’s capital city of Kigali. “I imagined it would be sad, like an orphanage,” she \n', 'says. Leila was pleasantly surprised to see all children dressed up in their uni-\n', 'forms—performing: singing, dancing, and smiling. “They really made me cry—it \n', 'reminded me of when I was little. It was just really beautiful.”\n', 'Maggy gives the children all these opportunities in life—to go to school, to \n', 'learn how to cook, and to get a job. Some choose art and others choose other \n', 'career paths. Most importantly she gives them dignity. “She wants them to feel \n', 'like this is just a moment in their life, that it doesn’t define the rest of their life,” \n', 'says Leila. She wants to build a strong generation of young people who can then \n', 'become the leaders their country so desperately needs. “If you give a hand in life, \n', 'that’s really what matters.”\n', 'As climate change increases the instability in countries across East Africa, \n', 'Leila feels a sense of urgency about increasing support for Maison Shalom.

An idea was born—\n', 'with a virtual birthday party for Demi at their kitchen table, with 40 friends and \n', 'family connected via Zoom. “My dad invited his friend Debbie Gibson,” says \n', 'Demi. “And someone else invited John Mayer who sang my favorite song, Don’t \n', ' 378\n', 'Stop Believing.” Then together, these two recording artists harmonized singing Hap-\n', 'py Birthday to Demi, and everyone joined in. “It was the coolest day of my life,” \n', 'Demi says. “I was like, ‘What has just happened?!’”\n', 'While she was being serenaded by Debbie Gibson and John Mayer, a \n', 'thought occurred to Demi. This was such a great way to gather people, to create \n', 'a sense of community, and to let them enjoy music without leaving the safety of \n', 'their homes. Why not organize Zoom concerts, invite people, and ask them to \n', 'donate money for a good cause? Thus was born Quarantunes. “I realized that \n', 'with Zoom, we have this amazing platform,” Demi says. “It’s a really great way \n', 'to connect people!”\n', 'Growing up in L.A. as the daughter of a successful agent, Demi is well aware \n', 'of her privilege. She is careful not to come across as spoiled, to drop names, or to \n', 'feed off of someone else’s work. “I’m the opposite of a flashy person,” she says. “I \n', 'try to understand my privilege and my good fortune.”\n', 'In order to make her idea happen, Demi had to learn a whole new skill set, \n', 'so she got busy. She started by setting up a GoFundMe page. Then she wrote a \n', 'short description about the first organization she chose to benefit. Every Christ-\n', 'mas, her family had supported their local community’s free clinic: they would \n', 'bring holiday cheer by “adopting a family,” buying gifts for the children and food \n', 'for the whole family. Sometimes they helped out with rent and medical expenses \n', 'too. Over the years, they’d adopted the same family, so Demi had been able to see \n', 'for herself the kinds of challenges they faced.\n', 'As she planned for the first Quarantunes concert, Demi set a goal of raising \n', '$10,000, then her father encouraged her to up the ante to $30,000. Demi was \n', 'thrilled when they surpassed their goal, raising $33,000. She knew what a differ-\n', 'ence it would make to the clinic. “This was an opportunity to start something that \n', 'is my own—and to give back,” Demi says. “I’m using this, and the things that I’ve \n', 'been given, to make a change.”\n', 'In high school, Demi had been an activist - joining her friends in protest-\n', 'ing gun violence, and working for women’s rights. In the fall of 2019, she made \n', 'posters for the Global Climate Action Strike with some of her environmentalist \n', 'friends. “They have inspired all of us to do the little things we can,” she says. “Like \n', 'switching from using single-use plastic water bottles to reusable water bottles.”\n', 'Living in Beverly Hills, Demi could see that under all the sparkle of celebrity \n', 'life was a serious crisis: 60,000 people were living on the streets in the “City of \n', 'Angels.” She could also see that low-income people were the most vulnerable to \n', 'the effects of climate change. Global warming is blamed for the five-fold increase \n', '379\n', 'in areas burnt in California over the last five decades: and in 2019 the housing \n', 'crisis in Los Angeles was exacerbated when 7,860 wildfires burned more than \n', '250,000 acres of land.\n', 'Then came the pandemic, and everyone was scrambling to provide shelter \n', 'for those 60,000 people. Clinics were in desperate need of support to provide ser-\n', 'vices and PPEs for all the homeless. “It’s a really bleak time,” Demi says. “People \n', 'are losing their jobs; they can’t even put a meal on the table for their families.”\n', 'This was an injustice that Demi was unwilling to accept. So, for the third \n', 'Quarantunes concert, she researched her options, and decided to partner with the \n', 'United Way Greater Los Angeles, the largest agency working with the homeless. \n', 'Someone offered to match all donations up to $50,000. And on April 4, 2020, \n', 'for two hours, while musicians entertained 200 of her friends via Zoom, Demi \n', 'worked her magic. She received enough donations to meet the challenge, and the \n', 'amount she brought in was doubled. “We ended up raising $100,000 in just 30 \n', 'hours,” she says. “It was amazing!”\n', 'Demi was really happy that with the funds they had raised, hundreds of \n', 'homeless people were given safe shelter in motel rooms, and Wellness Kits with \n', 'hand sanitizer, gloves, and face masks. Encouraged with their success, Demi and \n', 'her father decided to organize additional fundraising concerts. After organizing \n', 'just 10 Zoom benefit concerts, she had raised over $3,000,000. And as of April \n', '2021, they’ve raised $20 million and counting!\n', 'Her success is no surprise, considering the high-profile acts she gets to play: \n', 'John Legend, Rod Stewart, Sting, and James Bay, among others, have performed \n', 'for Quarantunes events. “You can see these artists in their homes, and me and \n', 'my dad in our kitchen—it’s a very welcoming and inviting space,” Demi says. I \n', 'feel like everyone’s on the same playing field. It’s like, we’re inviting you into our \n', 'home; and these artists are inviting you into theirs.”\n', 'Meanwhile, on some level, Demi’s days are like those of any other teenager \n', 'in quarantine. Her education is her #1 priority. To keep up with her schoolwork, \n', 'she is home schooling by Zooming with her teachers and classmates. “Then, in \n', 'between English and Math class, I go to my dad’s room, and jump in on a call,” \n', 'she says.\n', 'Behind the scenes, Demi is becoming a businesswoman. “My father’s life is \n', 'music,” she says. So, he’s in charge of inviting his musician friends to participate. \n', 'Demi and her father work together to set goals, and respond to donors’ requests. \n', 'Each week she researches potential beneficiaries and prepares interview questions \n', 'for the representatives of the organization, searching for the right match. “I’m \n', ' 380\n', 'learning so many aspects of the business” she says. And while she was once fearful \n', 'of public speaking, she now has lots of practice honing her speaking skills, as she \n', 'shares her passion for each organization’s work with her dad’s friends.\n', '“Usually I’ll interview someone that runs an organization - and we’ve had \n', 'some frontline workers on the Zoom call. It has been really great to connect to \n', 'people, to have the chance to shed light on crucial issues and raise awareness this \n', 'way.”\n', 'Increasingly, celebrities from the musical world have been joined by civ-\n', 'ic leaders like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Getting to hear from those in \n', 'charge of fighting the pandemic has been both educational and shocking, Demi \n', 'says. “Every call has been so inspiring,” Demi says. “You are hearing from people \n', 'from all different walks of life, with different experiences.”\n', 'Quarantunes’s support for local charities has now grown to include national \n', 'organizations, like the United Way’s relief efforts in six other cities. Beyond raising \n', 'money for the homeless, for clinics and food banks, Demi likes to educate people \n', 'who join their events. “All of their stories were very inspiring,” Demi says. “It’s \n', 'real and authentic—that’s the most beautiful part.”\n', 'Given her father’s national network of generous friends, Quarantunes has \n', 'been able to help in pandemic hot spots like New City’s public hospitals. They’ve \n', 'also supported hospitals across the country and the L.A. Food Bank. As the num-\n', 'ber of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. surpassed 100,000, it seems unlikely that \n', 'things will go back to normal anytime soon, Demi says. “The pandemic has liter-\n', 'ally changed the world as we know it,” she says. “These issues, and the people that \n', 'are suffering now: it’s not like it will go away in a second.”\n', 'The quarantine has impacted everyone’s lives on all levels. So, when the \n', 'Hollywood Bowl was closed for the first time in its 98-year history, people were \n', 'understandably upset. Every year this iconic outdoor venue is for many people \n', 'a favorite summer activity. Breathing fresh air under the overarching trees and \n', 'enjoying expansive views of the city, it offers people a welcome respite from their \n', 'busy lives and noisy highway traffic. Listening to their favorite musicians, it was \n', 'heavenly. And it is every musicians’ dream to one day play there.\n', 'So, when it was abruptly closed, Demi and her dad came up with a “wild \n', 'and crazy” idea. They made lots of phone calls and got permission to use it as \n', 'the venue for their 10th Quarantunes concert. They extended the limit to 1,000 \n', 'invitation-only guests—and kept it a secret. The concert was cohosted by music \n', 'legend and rainmaker, Clive Davis, who spoke of the power of music to unite, \n', 'and shared personal stories about each guest. The guests included Kenny Loggins \n', '381\n', '(who sang “Footloose”) and Gloria Gaynor (who sang “I Will Survive”), as well \n', 'as Barry Manilow, Santana, and Rob Thomas. Orchestra leader John Williams \n', 'opened the evening with the overture to Star Wars, with the trumpet section per-\n', 'forming on the Hollywood Bowl stage – all with social distancing, of course. And \n', 'Kevin Bacon did zoom dancing.\n', 'Demi is very proud of the beneficiaries they had chosen for this event: \n', 'Share Our Strength’s Billy Shore spoke about No Kid Hungry, proclaiming “This \n', 'is a problem we can solve.” Members of the Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles \n', 'members played a short piece. And Billie Ellish talked about her mother’s vegan \n', 'meal-delivery charity Support + Feed. One appreciative person on the Zoom \n', 'call said, “You are changing the narrative—from fear, anxiety, and isolation, to \n', 'connection and community.”\n', 'For Demi what started as an unusual birthday celebration has become a \n', 'life-changing experience.

88,Betsabe Reyna,A Voice For The Voiceless,383,387,"['A Voice For The Voiceless\n', 'Betsabe Reyna | New Jersey\n', 'One day while she was cleaning her room, Betsabe Reyna opened up her \n', 'journal from her first trip to Mexico, seven years earlier, and rediscovered this \n', 'entry.\n', 'I will do whatever I can, even if I risk my life for the sake of others.\n', 'While she didn’t remember writing it, when she read it, Betsabe felt an echo \n', 'of her earlier conviction deep in her soul. And she started crying. “Wow, this is it,” \n', 'she thought. “This is what I want to do with my life.”\n', 'Betsabe had grown up with a unique cultural perspective. Born in the Unit-\n', 'ed States with dual citizenship in Peru, she was raised in a small town in New \n', 'Jersey. From a young age, her parents had instilled in her a strong work ethic, \n', 'and morals that were guided by their Christian faith. Her family is a warm and \n', 'loving one, and she was particularly close to her mother. “My mother had a very \n', 'traditional upbringing,” Betsabe says. “So she has a wealth of insight to offer.”\n', 'But at school, Betsabe was more like an outcast. She didn’t enjoy school very \n', 'much, and she wasn’t sure what she wanted to do when she grew up. And as the \n', 'only Latina child in her class, she felt uncomfortable.\n', 'But all that changed at the age of 16 when she was offered the opportunity \n', 'to travel to Mexico with 30 other kids. In the summer of 2012, Betsabe traveled to \n', 'a small village in Mexico near Tijuana with her church’s youth group to volunteer \n', 'in an orphanage and work with the local community. There she witnessed a great \n', 'deal of violence in the streets, and heard stories about domestic abuse. It was both \n', 'shocking and scary for her to see this happening. The culture was so different than \n', 'the one she’d grown up in. It opened her eyes to the fact that some people live in \n', 'a very dangerous world, even in their own homes: and it instilled in her a passion \n', 'to do what she could to protect them and do what she could to help.\n', '383\n', 'Ever since that life-changing trip to Mexico, Betsabe has found ways to im-\n', 'merse herself in other cultures and other countries. And wherever she travels, she \n', 'tries to use her voice to speak out against the inequalities, and the injustice, that \n', 'makes the lives of so many people around the world so difficult.\n', 'In college, Betsabe studied theology and went on exchange to York, England. \n', 'While she knew that she wanted to do good in the world, she was unsure of how \n', 'to go about it. She had passion and drive, but she also needed direction, and \n', 'guidance. Then, several of her professors nominated Betsabe to travel to Greece \n', 'as a volunteer to help refugees. Along with five classmates, Betsabe spent three \n', 'weeks in Athens.\n', 'When she arrived in Greece, the mood in the Olympic stadium in Athens \n', 'was far different than the glorious fanfare of the summer games that had been \n', 'held there almost 15 years earlier. Then it was a spirit of celebration: now the \n', 'stadium was filled with thousands of desperate Afghani and Persian refugees who \n', 'were passing through Greece. The resources needed to help these people survive, \n', 'let alone build new lives, were just not available. All there was for them was an \n', 'empty cement building, bleachers, and a playing field. To make it worse, three \n', 'times a day, buses would unload more refugees at the stadium, sometimes hun-\n', 'dreds of people at a time. So it was overwhelming, and very discouraging.\n', 'Betsabe was assigned to distribute food, offer basic medical care, and refer \n', 'people to doctors and nurses when necessary. She and the other volunteers did \n', 'the best they could to help. It was hard work, and it was disheartening to not be \n', 'able to do more. But the people were really suffering and clearly needed her help, \n', 'so she knew she couldn’t just run away from the challenges. She dedicated herself \n', 'completely to her work and tried not to focus on all that she couldn’t do. Together, \n', 'this small team of 11 people helped several thousand people. Betsabe continued \n', 'her service for another 14 days at another refugee camp to help to manage the \n', 'program’s finances.\n', 'After graduating from college, Betsabe was trying to figure out what she \n', 'should do next when a thought came to her to travel to Turkey. At this time, Tur-\n', 'key had the highest concentration of displaced persons and refugees in the world. \n', 'She knew she was needed there.\n', 'At first, her mother wasn’t so enthusiastic about her going to that part of the \n', 'world. She was afraid that it could be dangerous. But she could see Betsabe’s pas-\n', 'sionate desire for positive change, and she didn’t want to stand in the way. So she \n', 'reached out to a friend who did mission work in Turkey, and who could provide \n', 'Betsabe with connections on the ground; and members of her church helped raise \n', ' 384\n', 'the money to pay her way.\n', 'When she got to Turkey, Betsabe traveled with five others in a small minivan, \n', 'arriving at a refugee camp just a short walk away from the Syrian border. Due to \n', 'the sensitivity of the mission, she had hardly any details about where she would \n', 'be stationed or what she would be doing before she got there. She’d had to put \n', 'her trust in God and in the organizing group. Now she discovered that she was \n', 'on the front lines of the refugee crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians were \n', 'fleeing from Bashar al-Assad’s brutal regime in Syria, and Turkey was often the \n', 'first border they crossed.\n', 'She had to put a lot of faith in God to help her through this time. All the pain \n', 'and suffering seemed unbearable to her otherwise. Regardless of their religion or \n', 'culture, Betsabe saw the people staying in the refugee camp as her brothers and \n', 'sisters. “Everyone fleeing violence and persecution is a human being,” she says. \n', '“No one chooses to be a refugee.”\n', 'One day, a group of five men drove up to the refugee camp in a pickup \n', 'truck. They opened fire and shot several of the men in the camp. Betsabe and \n', 'her coworkers hid in their minivan, hoping to stay safe. And it was while she was \n', 'huddling inside the van that she had a crushing realization. Her ability to escape \n', 'the gunfire and hide away gave her considerable privilege. Those staying in the \n', 'camp did not have that option. Once again, she promised herself that she would \n', 'do whatever she could to protect them.\n', 'These refugees were people who had been living normal lives before—peo-\n', 'ple with families, and jobs, and pets, and romances, and favorite books, and as-\n', 'pirations. “I realized that at any moment, normal life can be taken away from \n', 'anyone,” she says. And with the problems caused by climate change creating an \n', 'ever-increasing number of refugees in the world—by 2019 the UN reported there \n', 'were 70.8 million refugees worldwide—Betsabe knows very well that this is a \n', 'problem that is not going to just go away. In fact it is growing rapidly, even alarm-\n', 'ingly. “As long as I can, I will continue to fight for those who are suffering, and not \n', 'take anything for granted. Protecting the rights of people around the world is as \n', 'important to me as protecting my own family,” she says.\n', 'Now back in New Jersey, Betsabe is preparing for her future by studying \n', 'political science at Rutgers University. She also works on helping people across the \n', 'U.S. access clean power.

89,Cesar Chavez,Carrying On His Grandfather’s Legacy,387,393,"['Carrying On His Grandfather’s Legacy\n', 'Cesar Chavez | California\n', 'To millions of people across the United States, Cesar Chavez was “the Latin \n', 'Gandhi.” But to his namesake, the famous Cesar Chavez was just his grandfather. \n', 'When Anthony Chavez had his first son in 1981, he had given the baby his father’s \n', 'name. By then, the senior Cesar Chavez was traveling most of the time.\n', 'Little Cesar often heard stories about his grandfather; about how he had \n', 'awakened Americans nationwide to the plight of migrant farm workers in Cali-\n', 'fornia and convinced them to join them in boycotting one of their favorite fruits—\n', 'grapes. It took five long years, but eventually they got the farm owners to make \n', 'concessions—to stop using deadly pesticides - and that made a huge difference in \n', 'people’s lives.\n', 'Little Cesar often saw his grandfather on TV, as he went around the state, \n', 'inspiring union workers, demanding fair contracts from farmers, and challenging \n', 'state officials to care for all of their people. He always closed with the same mes-\n', 'sage: “When you have people together who believe in something very strongly \n', '- whether it’s religion or politics or unions - things happen,” he would tell them. \n', '“We can choose to use our lives for others; to bring about a better, and more just, \n', 'world for our children.”\n', 'It was always exciting when Cesar, the “gentle giant,” would finally come \n', '387\n', 'home from his travels. Most of the United Farm Workers (UFW) families lived \n', 'together on a 200-acre ranch near the Tehachapi Mountains, which had once \n', 'been a health center for people with tuberculosis. It had also once served as a \n', 'movie set. Then the director of the film sold it to the UFW for just $1. Cesar \n', 'called it “La Paz,” for the peacefulness he felt there. Being in nature was always \n', 'the best medicine to help him rest, especially after a long journey.\n', 'Cesar named their communal kitchen, where the community would share \n', 'meals together, Pan Y Vino (Bread and Wine). “He had studied cultures where the \n', 'people who worked together, ate together,” his grandson explains. He loved to \n', 'watch the children running around, sharing stories with his devoted community \n', 'of comrades. “All the volunteers working with the union, they weren’t just work-\n', 'mates—they were our friends, people we trusted and depended on.”\n', 'For most of his life, young Cesar lived next door to his grandfather. By the \n', 'time he woke up at 6:00 a.m. to go to school, he’d see his grandfather already \n', 'walking down the dirt road to begin his workday. Often, he’d come home late at \n', 'night. “I always knew he was really busy,” Cesar says, adding, “But he always took \n', 'time for us.”\n', 'After school, Cesar would stop by his grandfather’s office. “He’d stop what-\n', 'ever he was doing, even during meetings,” Cesar remembers. “He’d bring us in \n', 'and introduce us to everyone, then hug us and tell us he was busy and that we \n', 'should do our homework and come back later to visit.”\n', 'What he remembers most are the long hikes they’d take together into the \n', 'mountains. “He’d show me these beautiful trails, and places he called our secret \n', 'caves,” he says. “And we’d talk about grandfather- grandson things.”\n', 'A devoted student of Mahatma Gandhi, Cesar Chavez often fasted to bring \n', 'much-needed media attention to the farmworkers’ struggle. In 1987, he started \n', 'the Fast for Life. Little Cesar, who was just six, visited him every day and brought \n', 'him water. He fondly remembers the long hugs his grandfather would give him.\n', 'To Cesar, it seemed like a normal childhood, except that they lived at the \n', 'UFW headquarters. On Friday nights, all of Cesar’s cousins would join with his \n', 'father in the big hall to silkscreen the UFW’s black eagle onto red flags. “It was \n', 'great fun,” Cesar says. “We’d run with each flag to the end of the hall, lay it out \n', 'to dry, and run back for the next one.” By the end of the night there would be \n', 'thousands of flags laying all over the floor, waiting to be put onto poles. Cesar \n', 'would go to bed exhausted, but happy knowing the next day he’d see everyone \n', 'waving the flags, and that he had played a part.\n', 'Sometimes his grandfather would remind Cesar and his cousins of the \n', ' 388\n', 'deeper meaning of their work. Even though he had been born and raised in the \n', 'United States and served in the Army, he had felt the pain of being treated like a \n', 'second-hand citizen. He wanted his people to retain pride in their own heritage \n', 'as well in the contributions they had made to their new home. “Symbols are im-\n', 'portant,” he would say. “We chose the Aztec eagle for our symbol, because it gives \n', 'us pride. When our people see it, they feel a sense of dignity.”\n', 'Saturday mornings, Cesar, and his family and friends, would all pile into \n', 'station wagons and caravan down to that day’s march, strike, or demonstration \n', 'in Los Angeles or San Diego; or sometimes at their local supermarkets. While \n', 'their parents formed picket lines, the children would walk around the parking lot \n', 'passing out fliers and asking people for donations. Young and old, they each did \n', 'their part, in solidarity with those who were working away in hot fields without \n', 'health benefits, or enough food to feed their own families.\n', 'Cesar always wanted the children to walk close by him in the front of the \n', 'marches. He found joy and energy in their youthful enthusiasm and the songs \n', 'they’d sing, like “De Colores.” Along the way, the children often learned import-\n', 'ant lessons from him. “One time a van of children drove by flipping us off,” young \n', 'Cesar remembers. “We were mad–but my grandfather just waved to them and \n', 'gave them a big smile,” he says. “Later he talked with us about the importance of \n', 'nonviolence, of just being nice to one another. And he would say ‘There is enough \n', 'love and goodwill in our movement to give energy to our struggle and still have \n', 'plenty left over to change the climate of hate and fear around us.’”\n', 'Sometimes young Cesar and his cousins would become discouraged by the \n', 'seemingly overwhelming odds against them. “Our opponents in the agricultural \n', 'industry are very powerful; and farm workers are weak in money and influence,” \n', 'their grandfather would say. “But we have another kind of power that comes from \n', 'the justice of our cause. If we are willing to sacrifice for the cause, and persist in \n', 'nonviolence; and if we work to spread the message of our struggle, millions of \n', 'people around the world will respond from their hearts, will support our efforts...\n', 'And in the end, we will overcome.” Then, renewed by his heartfelt words, every-\n', 'one would smile, and shout out, “Viva la Causa!”\n', 'Cesar’s grandfather had always nourished his love for learning. Since he \n', 'himself had never had a chance to finish the eighth grade, he strongly encouraged \n', 'his people to stay in school and get a good education. And even though they were \n', 'making progress, he was troubled that Latinos were still dropping out of school at \n', 'record levels. Some had to leave, to get jobs so they could help feed their families. \n', 'However, too many were dropping out for the wrong reasons.\n', '389\n', 'Cesar Chavez knew that oppressed people throughout history often missed \n', 'out on getting an education. He also knew that the key to sustaining the move-\n', 'ment was to educate people about the issues; to help them distinguish facts from \n', 'myths, let them know what progress was being made, and learn about the battles \n', 'being won by their brothers and sisters in other parts of the country. He was \n', 'troubled that most books about the movement weren’t available in Spanish, so his \n', 'people couldn’t read about how they were making history.\n', 'On many levels, Cesar Chavez was way ahead of his time. Long before the \n', 'technology was ready, he had dreamed of creating a network of radio stations to \n', 'educate and entertain his people. He was determined to find a way to keep them \n', 'connected with up-to-date news so they could quickly respond when called to ac-\n', 'tion. He wanted to build on their Latino oral tradition, by passing on their history \n', 'through storytelling. He first tried to buy ad space on the local radio stations. “But \n', 'back in the 60’s and 70’s, the stations were all owned by the growers,” he told his \n', 'grandson. “They threw us out and told us never to come back.”\n', 'Undeterred, he pursued his dream in a most unconventional way. He de-\n', 'signed a plan to invent a makeshift microwave telephone system and received \n', 'a grant from the state of California to implement it. The phone system, with \n', 'satellite dishes on the mountaintops soon became the second largest in California, \n', 'next to Pacific Bell.\n', 'From an early age, young Cesar had shown promise in technology and had \n', 'taken an electronics class in high school. He’d been helping his father run the \n', 'UFW’s audio-visual equipment and installing their phone and alarm systems. “I \n', 'ran all the wire in the attics and basements, crawling through spider webs,” Cesar \n', 'says of his early adventures into the world of technology. So, he was a natural \n', 'candidate to help his grandfather build this new communications system. Soon he \n', 'was climbing mountains with his father, installing the satellite dishes and connect-\n', 'ing people in cities all over California. In the early days, it was quite a challenging \n', 'project. If just one of the dishes went down, half of the cities in the network \n', 'would be disconnected. Sometimes in the middle of the night, they’d have to \n', 'travel to the cold, icy mountaintops to fix one, returning the next morning just in \n', 'time for Cesar to go to school.\n', 'Finally, the project was ready: Cesar’s grandfather applied for their first ra-\n', 'dio license, housed it in the National Farm Workers Service Center, and named it \n', 'Radio Campesina. By May 1, 1983, they were on the air for the first time. Cesar \n', 'warmly welcomed all his listeners, his courageous words ringing out strong and \n', 'true. By November 1990 they were transmitting all the way to Phoenix, Arizona. \n', ' 390\n', 'After many long years, Cesar’s dream was finally starting to come true.\n', 'But he wouldn’t live to see the day when Radio Campesina would be con-\n', 'nected via the latest satellite technology, computers, and digital audio software.\n', 'Cesar Chavez died near where he was born, in Uma, Arizona, where he’d \n', 'been helping to fight another fight for his people. Young Cesar knew that some-\n', 'thing must be wrong when his father came to pick him up at school early one day. \n', 'After putting the younger children in the car, he put his arm around Cesar and \n', 'whispered in his ear, “Tata has passed away.” At first Cesar couldn’t believe his be-\n', 'loved grandfather was gone. But as they drove home, he heard the announcement \n', 'on the radio. Then it hit him, hard.\n', 'Cesar’s grandfather would have been proud of all those with careers in \n', 'law, medicine, and education, who brought their children to his funeral. Rudolfo \n', 'Anaya, known as a father of Chicano literature, gave the eulogy. “Our morning \n', 'star,” he called him. “...that luminous light that greeted workers as they gathered \n', 'around the dawn campfires.” And young Cesar read aloud the Prayer of St. Fran-\n', 'cis Assisi, in honor of his grandfather’s love of nature.\n', 'Cesar is now carrying on his grandfather’s legacy as the director of digital \n', 'strategy at the Cesar Chavez Foundation. “Everything my grandfather fought for \n', 'is still worth fighting for,” he says, and adds, “Every day I realize how much the \n', 'world needs to change, so our people can have equal rights, and peace. I try every \n', 'day to push myself toward that goal, the way my grandfather did.”\n', 'Now every day from 5:30 am to 3:00 pm., Radio Campesina is broadcast \n', 'to people in eight states. During the workday, it lifts workers’ spirits by playing \n', 'Nortena Banda top 40’s music. Local experts are featured on a 30-minute talk \n', 'show. A paralegal informs them of their immigration rights; a highway patrol-\n', 'man urges them to wear seat belts; a nurse tells them how to protect themselves \n', 'from the effects of pesticides.

Her father, Robert F. Kennedy, would take time off from his \n', 'active public life of political, civic, and civil rights advocacy, and take the family \n', 'on trips around the United States.\n', 'Robert F. Kennedy was attorney general during the Civil Rights movement, \n', 'so the concepts of equality and justice were very central to Kerry’s experience \n', 'growing up. In fact, they were of the utmost importance in her home. “I remem-\n', 'ber, for instance, that when I learned how to tie my shoes, if I put my left shoe on \n', 'first, I was taught to be sure to tie my right shoe first; because it was important that \n', 'things always be fair. I mean, where does a child pick up an idea like that? It’s got \n', 'to be from their parents. And it certainly was in my case.”\n', 'On their summer trips across the U.S. they’d stop in wilderness areas to raft, \n', 'camp, or hike, so she and her siblings could experience firsthand the many natural \n', 'wonders that this great, expansive country had to offer – which she still advocates \n', 'for to this day.\n', 'But for Kerry’s father, there was always more than that. He was always cam-\n', 'paigning at least part-time, even when they were on a family vacation. Ever an \n', 'advocate for the most vulnerable, he brought Kerry to some of the poorest areas \n', 'in the country, where people were suffering in incredibly difficult conditions, to \n', 'show her how “the other half” lived.\n', 'When they were out west, they would often stop at remote Indian reserva-\n', 'tions and speak with members of the tribe about the problems and issues they \n', 'were facing. When they were in the eastern part of the country, they’d campaign \n', 'in similarly downtrodden locales like rural Appalachia, and her dad’s approach \n', 'was always the same: he always tried to find out what the people needed, and \n', 'how he could help them. And always, Kerry was close by his side, and watching \n', ' 404\n', 'carefully.\n', 'When he ran for president in 1968, she was only 8 years old, but she helped \n', 'in the campaign in any small way she could. “He was always full of laughs and \n', 'fun, and we just loved being around him,” she says. “But he also taught us to \n', 'understand all of the hardships people face in our country.” She remembers that \n', 'above all, her father thought it was important that she understand what public \n', 'service is about. “There are many Americas,” she says. “And it’s a truth that one \n', 'can never be too young to begin trying to understand that.”\n', 'After listening to searing testimony about conditions in Mississippi by Mar-\n', 'ian Wright—a 27-year-old Yale Law School graduate who was working with the \n', 'NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund in the state—to his Senate Subcommittee on Pov-\n', 'erty in April 1967, Kennedy followed Wright through the heart of the Delta, a \n', 'region in northwest Mississippi known for its entrenched racism and suffocating \n', 'poverty. He was joined by fellow senator Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania.\n', 'As he often did, he had brought her siblings along to the meeting. Kerry \n', 'remembers him commanding the room where she and all her brothers and sisters \n', 'were seated. They were a rowdy bunch, but when her father began to speak, a \n', 'rare quiet came over the room, as everyone listened to hear what he would say. He \n', 'looked around the room, shook his head, and then he said, quietly, “I’ve just been \n', 'to a part of this country where three families live in a room the size of this one, \n', 'and I want you to do something to help these children.”\n', 'For Kerry, everything about her dad was interesting, and inspiring. Because \n', 'of his example, she grew up believing that public service was what you wanted to \n', 'do, because that was what made life meaningful. It wasn’t a feeling of obligation, \n', 'or a feeling that was burdensome. It was more a sense of an honorable duty. “But \n', 'that particular instance [at the meeting of the subcommittee on poverty] is the \n', 'only time I remember him saying, “You have to be involved.” She adds, “That mo-\n', 'ment, as much as any, set me up on my journey into advocacy - and particularly \n', 'on a journey toward exposing the many abuses that go on around this world, in \n', 'all of their forms.”\n', 'Tragedy struck Kerry’s family shortly thereafter, when in June 1968, after \n', 'winning the California presidential primary, her father was assassinated. Though \n', 'she was only 8 years old, Kerry knew that she would dedicate her life to carrying \n', 'on the legacy of the noble ideals that her father had believed in so deeply. And \n', 'she would act in accordance with her favorite quote by her father; it laid out a \n', 'pathway for her own future work, and for the life she was going to lead.\n', '405\n', '“Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others,\n', ' or strikes out against injustice,\n', 'he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and \n', 'crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and\n', 'daring those ripples build a current which\n', ' can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”\n', 'To carry on the work of a humanitarian and advocate as great as her father \n', 'was wouldn’t be easy. But Kerry always kept those words in mind. She remem-\n', 'bered them, and believed that each small act of hers would “send forth a tiny \n', 'ripple of hope” into the world, that would build toward a more just future.\n', 'When she was in 6th grade, Kerry took her first public stand in service of \n', 'an ideal. It was 1972, and Watergate was dominating the news cycle. For school, \n', 'she had to write a biography of a famous person. “I chose Cesar Chavez. And my \n', 'best friend said, ‘Who’s Cesar Chavez?’ and I said, ‘Well, how come you’ve never \n', 'heard of him? He’s as famous as Richard Nixon.’ And she said, ‘No, he’s not. I’ve \n', 'never heard of him.’” They argued about the merits of who was more famous \n', 'and who deserved to be more famous – but the important thing for Kerry was her \n', 'belief that Chavez should be a household name. Certainly in her home he had \n', 'an enormous presence. Her family boycotted grapes and lettuce in solidarity with \n', 'the farmers’ struggle. So Kerry knew that Cesar Chavez had a story that needed \n', 'to be told.\n', 'Some 16 years later, in 1988, her father’s words echoed as true as if they \n', 'had just been spoken; as Kerry took a small stand in support of an ideal, and \n', 'that small act in support of Chavez’s struggle led her on a course that brought \n', 'her into contact with the great humanitarian himself. Chavez was embarking on \n', 'his last great fast, and when doctors advised that he must end it or risk death, \n', 'other leaders around the country picked it up and traveled with it. A network of \n', 'human rights advocates and celebrities joined together to bring Chavez’s uplifting \n', 'message of solidarity forward, and Kerry took part in in too. “I had the honor \n', 'of carrying the message forward from New York to Boston,” she says. “It was a \n', 'powerful thing to be a part of.”\n', 'Over the more than 50 years since her father’s tragic death, Kerry has lived \n', 'up to being the fearless humanitarian and advocate for the disinherited that he in-\n', 'spired her to be in more ways than he could have possibly dreamed. What started \n', 'in her kitchen one day, having an argument with her best friend, has blossomed \n', ' 406\n', 'into a life of service few can rival – both in the scope, and the breadth of the issues \n', 'she has fought for.\n', '“Human rights defenders teach us not how to be saints, but how to be fully \n', 'human,” she says. And in all of her work, this is precisely what Kerry has done. \n', 'She has published a number of books, including Speak Truth to Power, which tells \n', 'heroic tales of advocacy; and her writing has been featured in many newspapers. \n', 'She has spoken out in favor of bail reform and other issues that stem from systemic \n', 'racism. She has worked with Break Bread Not Families, to bring awareness to the \n', 'current situation for refugees at the southern border of the United States, through \n', 'fasting and prayer.

While Anna had \n', 'been raised to think about where her food came from, until that trip, the ideas had \n', 'always been abstract for her.\n', 'Growing up, Anna split her time between her parents’ homes, both of whom \n', 'were passionate activists with a common goal: to make the world a healthier, safer, \n', 'more equitable place. Typical family dinner conversations revolved around issues \n', 'of world hunger, social injustice, or the dangers of toxic chemicals. That trip to \n', 'Ohio brought home to her those many conversations over the years.\n', 'Since the 1970s, Anna’s mother, Frances Moore Lappé, had been explor-\n', 'ing the root causes of hunger and inequality in the United States and beyond. \n', 'Through her mother’s work, Anna learned firsthand about the impact of United \n', 'States foreign policy, development aid, and farm programs. She learned about \n', 'inequality in the United States and the exploitation of the people who grow the \n', 'country’s food and how farmworkers are regularly exposed to toxic pesticides.

She knew that the lettuce, grapes, and tomatoes that come to \n', 'dinner tables from thousands of miles away also come with grave human and \n', 'environmental costs.\n', 'Anna knew she had to do something. Luckily, she had her mother to guide \n', 'her. Frances Moore Lappé had sparked a revolution with her book, Diet for a Small \n', 'Planet, which has sold over three and a half million copies since it was published \n', 'in 1971. The book radically reshaped the conversation about hunger, helping \n', 'people see that the real cause of hunger is not a scarcity of food, but a scarcity \n', 'of democracy and how our industrial animal agriculture squanders abundance \n', 'in raising factory farmed livestock. The book urges people to adopt a healthy, \n', 'plant-centered diet to minimize the environmental costs of our food consumption \n', 'and provides recipes for such a diet. But more than that, the book encourages \n', 'its readers to see themselves as actively shaping the world around them, through \n', 'everyday choices like what they eat to big choices like what they do with their lives.\n', 'Her mother had always been a role model for Anna: she sparked Anna’s \n', 'curiosity about social justice and the food system. Some of Anna’s most vivid \n', 'childhood memories are of spending time at her mother’s office at the non-profit \n', 'she cofounded, the Institute for Food and Development Policy known as Food \n', 'First. She remembers afternoons on the office couch reading institute newsletters \n', 'and evenings stuffing donation envelopes for fundraising drives with her mother’s \n', 'coworkers. Like her mother, her father also had committed his life to rooting out \n', 'injustice, as a scientist and medical ethicist.

The \n', 'most pressing issue facing the Indigenous people of British Columbia (B.C) was \n', 'the destruction of forests caused by clear-cut logging, the pollution of natural \n', 'water systems, and the ramifications of these things on their traditional way of \n', 'life. “Thankfully, my parents always brought us along when they were working \n', 'with these vulnerable communities. I really felt like I was involved, and had a say. \n', 'It was really empowering.”\n', 'Since the late 1970s, the Suzuki family has been courageously fighting for \n', 'environmental and Indigenous rights in B.C. For more than 40 years, geneticist \n', 'David Suzuki has been a mainstay on Canadian television, hosting The Nature of \n', 'Things, a documentary program on nature and society. This platform has allowed \n', 'his family’s message of environmental justice for all to reach a vast audience. But \n', 'the heart, soul, and genesis of their enduring environmental legacy lies with the \n', 'Indigenous peoples of B.C.\n', 'On a work-related trip to the Amazon, the Suzukis met a man who would \n', 'change the direction and the impact of their activism, from small-scale and local, \n', 'to far-reaching and global. Paiakan was an Indigenous leader who was fighting \n', 'against the construction of a massive hydroelectric dam in Brazil, that would \n', 'flood thousands of hectares of pristine rainforest, and destroy countless Indige-\n', 'nous communities. “Of course, my Mom and Dad did what they always did; they \n', 'got involved in the fight,” Severn says. Her mother, Tara, an accomplished writer, \n', 'activist, and organizer, led a fundraising effort that allowed them to bring Paiakan \n', 'to Canada. There, she organized a meeting of Indigenous groups to confront the \n', 'World Bank, which was funding the project – and they succeeded in getting the \n', 'project stopped.\n', 'In the aftermath of this victory, Paiakan and his family received death \n', 'threats, so the Suzukis brought them to Canada to escape danger.\n', 'When it was safe to return to their home the following year, the Suzukis \n', 'traveled with them to ensure their safe arrival, and they were invited to stay in \n', 'Paiaka’s home in the Amazon. “It was transformational for me as a young girl. \n', 'Fishing for piranhas from the banks of the river we had just been swimming in. \n', 'Living in a sparkling green jungle. It was beyond my wildest imagination – and it \n', 'was real,” Severn remembers.\n', 'After a few weeks in the jungle, it was time for the Suzukis to go back home. \n', 'They got into a tiny plane that took them over the jungle toward the nearest \n', 'town; but as they climbed into the sky, their windows quickly became completely \n', 'covered in smoke. “As I got brief glimpses of the jungle below, I saw tons of \n', ' 416\n', 'fires burning everywhere. It was heartbreaking to see this incredible world being \n', 'burned to the ground. Then I saw the farm and cattle operations scarring the land. \n', 'I decided right then and there that I had to do something about it.”\n', 'When Severn arrived home, she told her friends about what she’d experi-\n', 'enced, and how she wanted to help preserve these pristine places. She quickly \n', 'gained support from her peers, who understood the importance of her mission \n', '– but they didn’t know where or how to direct their energy. Thankfully her Mom \n', 'had an idea for them. “Why don’t you start a club, and organize?” she suggested. \n', 'So Severn and four of her friends started the Environmental Children’s Organiza-\n', 'tion (ECO), to advocate for intergenerational environmental justice.\n', 'At age 12, Severn successfully raised enough funds to travel with ECO to \n', 'the 1992 UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – the very country that had \n', 'inspired her activism some years prior. ECO only planned to attend the summit as \n', 'spectators. But when one of the speakers dropped out, Severn saw an opportunity \n', 'to get the youth perspective on these issues out to the world. “We watched as all of \n', 'these old people were sitting around discussing the future; but we were the ones \n', 'who would be suffering from the consequences of their decisions,” Severn says. \n', '“Who was speaking for us?” So she stepped up, and showed unbelievable resolve \n', 'as she gave a powerful speech in front of many of the leading figures in the envi-\n', 'ronmental movement including now Secretary John Kerry, former Vice President \n', 'Al Gore and others. Seeds were planted then for environmental movements now.\n', 'A decade later, her speech became a viral sensation, called “The Girl Who \n', 'Silenced the World For 5 Minutes.” It reached more than 32 million people. \n', '“What was occurring, and what is still occurring, is that the people in power are \n', 'ignoring their sacred duty to preserve the world for their children,” she says. “It’s \n', 'amazing to see the world finally starting to wake up to the concept of intergener-\n', 'ational justice, after so many years. I’m proud of the young people, and ashamed \n', 'that it has taken us so long to get on board.”\n', 'After her speech, Severn was invited to sit on the Earth Charter Commission \n', 'and help draft guidelines on how people should be engaging with each other and \n', 'the planet in the 21st century. “We need an architecture for a different way of \n', 'being, and it should be intergenerational. Young people have always been on the \n', 'forefront of social change; they must be central to our guiding societal principles. \n', 'A lot of people have been advocating for these sorts of things since the 1980s - it \n', 'wasn’t ever just me. I was falling in line with a tradition of young people being \n', 'revolutionaries.”\n', 'In this tradition, Severn, along with Our Children’s Trust, has advised a \n', '417\n', 'group of 15 youth litigants from British Columbia, who are taking up the mantle. \n', 'In October 2019, La Rose vs Canada was brought to the Supreme Court to con-\n', 'tend that Canada has not been protecting the constitutional rights and liberties \n', 'of its young people, who are being unjustly impacted by the ramifications of our \n', 'environmental crisis. “It’s heartbreaking that it has been left to our kids to take \n', 'on this burden,” Severn says. “But it’s amazing to see the clarity and dedication \n', 'they have. It reignites that passion in me.” She, the David Suzuki Foundation, and \n', 'Ecojustice, are all supporting the case.\n', 'With so many new ways to connect digitally, and to create communities \n', 'through social media platforms, and with so many visible role models, Severn is \n', 'sure that youth movements will continue to grow. Still, she believes that getting \n', 'back to nature is necessary for the younger generation to gain a full appreciation \n', 'of the natural world. “As a parent, that was my main focus for my kids. We live \n', 'in an Indigenous community on an archipelago where the Haida have lived for \n', 'over 14,000 years. I wanted my kids to experience the way of life their ancestors \n', 'did. I wanted to ground them in their homeland. And now that they have that \n', 'connection, we can shift our focus to defend it – and defend the Earth at large.”\n', 'She also wants aspiring youth environmentalists to understand that a re-\n', 'imagined future isn’t something intangible or out of reach. In fact, she hopes the \n', 'movement will continue to support and understand the significance of Indigenous \n', 'people, who have practiced sustainable living throughout human history. “The \n', 'current way of life that we are experiencing is just one iteration of how a human \n', 'society can function.

I began to go to the gym to learn how to fight back and \n', 'defend myself.”\n', 'Thankfully, his parents recognized the seriousness of the situation, and \n', 'thought it wise to bring Arun to India to live with his grandfather, Mahatma \n', 'Gandhi. There the 12-year-old could learn from the great teacher himself, before \n', 'he let anger take control of his life.\n', 'Arun’s parents knew that the temptation to respond to prejudice with vio-\n', 'lence and anger had occurred in their family before. In fact, the great Mahatma \n', '419\n', 'himself had had a very similar experience early in his life.\n', 'As a young lawyer, Mahatma Gandhi had been the victim of racial prejudice \n', 'upon arriving in South Africa. He’d been thrown off the first-class car of a train, \n', 'since people of his color were banned from traveling first class. This humilia-\n', 'tion made him really angry. Initially he felt compelled to react to this treatment \n', 'with anger. However, before lashing out, he stopped himself, realizing that using \n', 'anger would only perpetuate a cycle of violence—and would ultimately turn \n', 'into something even worse. He vowed right then and there to dedicate his life \n', 'to doing whatever he could to stop this cycle of violence, beginning with himself. \n', 'And he famously went about creating a practice of using nonviolence to resolve  \n', 'sociopolitical and interpersonal conflicts.\n', 'He delved deeply into studying Ahimsa, the principle of nonviolence toward \n', 'all living things. Ahimsa is a central tenet of many eastern religions, found in the \n', 'ancient codes and texts of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Little did this angry \n', 'young man know that one day his life, and his message of the power of nonviolent \n', 'response to oppression would influence the world’s greatest civil rights leaders, \n', 'including Dr. Martin Luther King and Cesar Chavez—and would ultimately lead \n', 'to a massive improvement in the lives of millions of people around the world.\n', 'When Arun arrived in India, his grandfather shared the teachings of Ahimsa \n', 'with his grandson. And he talked to him openly about his own difficulties in con-\n', 'trolling his anger. “Ahimsa extends far beyond physical nonviolence; it must include \n', 'all forms of passive nonviolence,” Arun explains. “It doesn’t simply mean ‘Don’t \n', 'hit, don’t hurt, don’t kill, don’t harm.’ Ahimsa extends to the negative things we say \n', 'to one another. Our destructive actions. It even extends to our thinking, like the \n', 'negative patterns of thought we find ourselves in, or the anxieties we fixate upon.”\n', 'Arun’s grandfather told him to write every day in an anger journal, to help \n', 'him learn how to manage his anger and search for positive solutions. “This helped \n', 'me understand my anger, and learn how to channel the energy of anger into \n', 'something positive,” Arun says. “That’s the most powerful lesson he taught me: to \n', 'use the energy constructively, rather than destructively.”\n', 'Arun sees an analogy between the power of anger, and the power of elec-\n', 'tricity. “It’s just as useful, and just as powerful, but only if we use it intelligently,” \n', 'he says. “It can be just as destructive too: so we must channel this energy to be in \n', 'service of the good of humanity.” He pauses, then adds, “I believe this type of \n', 'training should be compulsory education for young people. So much pain and \n', 'violence in the world could be avoided if youth understood how to channel their \n', 'anger.”\n', ' 420\n', 'Arun fondly remembers walking by his grandfather’s side as they traveled \n', 'through the villages of India. There he could sense the greatness of this man \n', 'he called Grandfather. After dinner each night he had a nightly practice of  \n', 'self-analysis with his grandfather. “He made me draw a genealogical tree of vi-\n', 'olence, like a family tree. In the tree, violence was a grandparent, and physical \n', 'violence and passive violence were the two offspring.”\n', 'Every night before Arun went to bed, he would do this self-analysis, think-\n', 'ing about what had made him angry during the day, and putting it on the tree. \n', '“Physical violence we know about and understand. We see it and we can see that \n', 'it hurts,” he says. “Yet we don’t think about passive violence when we are young. \n', 'There are many things we do that we just don’t think of as being violent. Any-\n', 'thing we do that hurts somebody or something, directly or indirectly, is violence. \n', 'Hoarding resources. Overconsumption, when so many are going hungry. And of \n', 'course, the way we treat the natural world around us; the environment.” He adds, \n', '“All this analysis made me realize that passive violence fuels physical violence; so \n', 'we must cut off the fuel supply, which comes from each one of us. It is just as my \n', 'grandfather said: we must be the change we want to see in the world.”\n', 'Mahatma Gandhi was one of the first to recognize the dangers of the global \n', 'climate situation. He spoke out against violence against nature in all its forms. He \n', 'stressed that when we don’t live in harmony with the natural world, it’s inevitable \n', 'that we will destroy nature – and ourselves. For today’s youth leaders in the envi-\n', 'ronmental movement, Arun believes that his grandfather’s message would be the \n', 'same.\n', '“My grandfather always tried to convince people to bring about a change,” \n', 'he says. “Our leaders preach, but they don’t practice. If we want to seriously deal \n', 'with the climate situation and get the people of the world to stand hand in hand, \n', 'the leading countries must follow their own advice. Even children learn more \n', 'from what they see than what they hear. It’s the same message for adults in this \n', 'movement, who are working either on their own efforts, or in support of their \n', 'children: you must live what you want others to learn.”\n', 'As a self-described “peace farmer,” Arun has taught countless numbers of \n', 'people over the years how to abide by the principles of Ahimsa. In 1987 he and \n', 'his beloved wife Sunanda were invited by the University of Mississippi to study \n', 'racial prejudice in South Africa, India, and the U.S. Then in 1991 they founded \n', 'The M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence. They spent decades traveling back \n', 'to India to work with orphanages and homelessness there.\n', 'Over the years Arun has been increasingly troubled by the destruction of \n', '421\n', 'the environment, in both South Africa and India. In impoverished communities, \n', 'he was disturbed seeing mining operations with little or no regulation, and heavy \n', 'deforestation. Wherever he goes, the main thread he sees linking this destruction \n', 'of the environment is poverty.\n', '“Everywhere I go I see the same thing. Wherever there is poverty, there is \n', 'more pollution. If we don’t eradicate poverty in the world, we won’t be able to \n', 'stop this environmental degradation. Millions of people in India and Africa live \n', 'in such poverty that they are forced to use up any resource they can just to survive. \n', 'Miners wear out their land to sell coal and oil to rich countries. When they don’t \n', 'have the money for cooking or heating oil, people go into the forest, and chop \n', 'down trees to use as fuel. When the forest gets used up, they must burn things \n', 'like plastics and garbage to keep themselves alive in winter, and this causes mas-\n', 'sive amounts of pollution.” He pauses, and sighs. Then he adds, “This sort of \n', 'problem can’t be addressed without addressing poverty. Unless desperately poor \n', 'people have an alternative, we can’t really save the environment. There has to be a  \n', 'balance between materialism and morality.”\n', 'Arun’s global travels have caused him to focus his energy on compassion as \n', 'a necessary part of any healing.\n', '“Some of the most devastating social problems in the world, like homeless-\n', 'ness and poverty, can’t be solved by government. Government does not have the \n', 'capacity to deal with the issue of compassion. Simply pouring money into an issue \n', 'does not eradicate it. It can only be solved by rebuilding self-respect and self-con-\n', 'fidence in people – and that can only be done by people like you and me,” he says. \n', 'But he adds that those who are attempting to help need to maintain a sense of \n', 'humility. “We must listen to the people with these problems. Sit with them, talk \n', 'with them, and try to understand from their perspective how their problems can \n', 'best be resolved. This is what nonviolence teaches us: humility, and compassion, \n', 'and love. And understanding.”\n', 'Today, 86 years old, Arun is still inspiring people. After his beloved wife \n', 'passed, he moved to Rochester, New York to be near his daughter and her family. \n', 'He is often invited to lecture and talk to people, and to write about climate change \n', 'and nonviolence.

No matter \n', 'where he went, Dr. Ari’s message was always the same: by awakening one person, \n', 'it could lead to awakening a whole family; then an entire community; and then, \n', 'one day, even the world.\n', 'Sarvodaya is now the country’s largest community-based NGO: it has \n', 'comprehensive programs in maternal and early childhood education, commu-\n', 'nity health, rural technical services, woodworking, international volunteers, and \n', 'partnerships with the Institute for Higher Learning; in disaster management, and \n', 'Deshodaya’s self-governance program to engage ordinary citizens in consensual \n', 'politics, and to promote democracy, good governance, reconciliation, and sustain-\n', 'able peace. At last year’s 60th anniversary celebration, people from all over the \n', 'world traveled to Sri Lanka to honor Dr. Ari’s great work.\n', 'For Niven and Tiara, the Peace Marches Dr. Ari led are especially memora-\n', 'ble, since they happened around the time they were born, in 2007. For more than \n', '30 years a civil war had plagued their beautiful country. Dr. Ari and Sarvodaya \n', 'had mobilized millions of people to take a stand for peace. They worked alongside \n', 'the brave soldiers who gave their lives for this noble cause. For his constant mes-\n', 'sage of inspiring people to live together in peace, Dr. Ari became known as “the \n', 'Gandhi of Sri Lanka.” Niven and Tiara moved back to Sri Lanka from the U.S., \n', 'and lived safely with their families and friends.\n', 'Dr. Ari is happy to see his grandchildren enthusiastically embark on this \n', 'project to help children learn English.\n', 'He is tickled with their resourcefulness, and he is proud of the new club they \n', 'have started: YouthForce. Niven is president of the club: he knew he needed a \n', 'good organizer, so he asked his sister Tiara to be vice president. His 15-year-old \n', 'cousin Sanara is an aspiring author: Niven asked her to be the club’s secretary. \n', 'Established in 2019 YouthForce has now grown to 20 members. For a year they \n', 'collected supplies - books, pens and pencils, stationary, coloring books - and raised \n', 'funds to buy ecofriendly cloth bags. Then they traveled to Kalawana from Colom-\n', '425\n', 'bo to deliver them. Everyone was grateful for their support.\n', 'Next, Sanara recorded the cellphone numbers for all 35 children, and each \n', 'YouthForce member picked two children to sponsor. Now they call every weekend \n', 'to check on their progress. They ask them: What did you learn? How did you \n', 'practice your English this week? And these 5-10-minute phone calls in English \n', 'are changing their lives.\n', 'Like his grandfather, Niven has a twinkle in his eyes. When he was about \n', '9 years old, people started to see his grandfather’s spirit shining through him. \n', 'The second-youngest of Dr. Ari’s 12 grandchildren, Niven is now growing into a \n', 'youth leader. At 13, he is helping to organize Shramadamas like his grandfather \n', 'taught him. He organizes tree planting projects, partnering with youth groups like \n', 'Interact. He leads the prayers and songs; most importantly he acknowledges each \n', 'and every one who helped create the project.\n', 'YouthForce is now envisioning a major tree planting program. Niven, Tiara, \n', 'and Sanara have seen how climate change is affecting their country, especially in \n', 'the rural areas. Landslides, beach erosion, oppressive heat waves, and extreme \n', 'and unpredictable weather changes are affecting farmers’ crops. In Sri Lanka the \n', 'forest cover has been reduced from 50 percent to just 20 percent in just 10 years. \n', 'The children’s favorite beach is gone, left with only rough rocks along the shore.\n', 'In 2004, Sri Lanka was ravaged with its first tsunami. Over 30,000 peo-\n', 'ple died, and thousands lost their homes. Immediately after the storm, Dr. Ari \n', 'texted Sarvodaya’s 26 districts and set up partnerships between those who had \n', 'weathered the storm, with those whose villages had been destroyed. For its rapid \n', 'response and organized relief efforts, Sarvodaya won the UN’s prestigious Award \n', 'for Tsunami Rehabilitation. As part of their rehabilitation program, they had \n', 'built a comprehensive Eco-Village for homeless families that is now a model of \n', 'sustainable living.\n', 'YouthForce wants to help protect these villages using its own resources. \n', 'They’ve heard the legend about their grandfather’s birthplace, where King Hanu-\n', 'man is said to have lifted a whole mountain to find the powerful medicinal herbs \n', 'underneath. Dr. Ari’s grandchildren are deepening their appreciation for their \n', 'country’s biodiversity - and they realize they must do whatever they can to help \n', 'preserve and protect it. From scientists they’ve learned that “big trees” are the best \n', '- since they help regulate the climate, the water cycle, and provide precious shade \n', 'in the heat, while creating vital habitats for creatures. “Every day, the Kalawana \n', 'children walk among these big trees,” thought Niven. “Why not invite them to \n', 'collect the seeds from these trees off of the forest floor? Then we can bring the big \n', ' 426\n', 'tree seeds from the forest to Colombo for their next tree planting project.”\n', 'Niven and YouthForce traveled to Kalawana for the Sinhala New Year in \n', 'April. “We organized speakers, instructional games, and fun activities - all in En-\n', 'glish!” he says, enthusiastically. To encourage more people to join and support \n', 'them, they created a short video describing their project. Niven is grateful to \n', 'everyone at Sarvodaya for their support, especially Sarvodaya’s liaison to Youth-\n', 'Force, Yamuna Balasooriya for their special support. They’ve found a host family \n', 'for a Sarvodaya volunteer from England, who now lives in Kalawana and works \n', 'with the children. Last week the village teacher called Neetha to say how motivat-\n', 'ed the children are. They were getting good grades, too. The teacher predicts that \n', 'soon the number of students being tutored will have doubled. The whole village \n', 'wants to learn English!\n', 'Now 88 years old, Dr. Ari enjoys being at home, where photographs of \n', 'his grandchildren’s smiling faces adorn the kitchen wall. To them, he is “Seeya” \n', '(grandfather). His home is always open to any children who come by to visit. They \n', 'too call him Seeya. “We must listen to our young people, and help to awaken their \n', 'potential,” says Dr. Ari. “They have some great ideas, and they need our support.”\n', 'Niven loves sharing stories with his Seeya about his project, about the \n', 'children in the forest who are learning English. He treasures just sitting by his \n', 'grandfather: listening, watching, and learning. He hopes that one day he will grow \n', 'into his grandfather’s shoes. For now he proudly “stands on the shoulders” of \n', 'those—those in his family, and all those—who have dedicated their lives to the \n', 'Sarvodaya. “I’ll never forget my grandfather’s message,” Niven says. “Awakening, \n', 'caring for others, sharing our gifts, carrying on his legacy.”\n', 'At the end of every Shramadama, they sing this song.\n', 'May there be seasonal rains\n', 'May the harvest be bountiful\n', 'May the minds of all beings be peaceful \n', 'May the rulers be righteous. \n', '******************\n', 'Let’s spread boundless loving-kindness to the entire universe,\n', ' towards all living beings including\n', ' humans, animals and plant kingdom. \n', 'Having universal thoughts of loving kindness\n', '427\n', ' to entire humanity irrespective of cast, creed or religion\n', ' and acting with this universal vision\n', 'is the only way to get through this challenge.\n', 'Dr. Ari Ariyaratne\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'Support Sarvodaya’s work of building and sustaining healthy communities \n', 'in Sri Lanka: www.sarvodaya.org\n', ' 428\n', '\n', 'VII\n', 'EACH ONE TEACH ONE \n', 'Emerging Island Leaders\n', 'These dedicated young people are a shining example of \n', 'how we can imagine a more sustainable world.

And in spite of daunting odds, they \n', 'dreamed of a better life. Today, 20 years later they are lawyers, doctors, business \n', 'executives. And each and every one of them is an inspiration to their island com-\n', 'munity.\n', 'In 2004 I went to Vieques in search of a quiet place on the water to finish \n', 'this book. However, when the mayor of Vieques saw his prison cellmate, actor \n', 'Edward James Olmos’s name on the cover of the Spanish edition of the first book, \n', 'Pan Y Vino Para El Camino, he asked the Institute to help him rebuild his island com-\n', 'munity. It was then that we turned the Institute upside down to work directly with \n', 'the young people. Given they spoke Spanish, we invited Spanish-speaking people \n', 'from my first book, Stone Soup for the World, to serve as faculty for the Institute’s first \n', 'Sustainability Summit.  The actor Edward James Olmos sent a welcome video \n', 'to greet the youth delegates. Nane Alejandrez led an indigenous ‘passing of the \n', 'torch feather ceremony’.  And the grandson of Cesar Chavez inspired Vieques \n', 'youth with his family’s stories of their work with farmworkers in California. Over \n', 'the next four years, we created a bi-lingual demonstration project – and mentored \n', 'these youth to build a new generation of leaders.\n', 'Islands are a great place to write.  I had first gone to the island of Martha’s \n', 'Vineyard to walk on the beach, and think about a question: “What was I being \n', 'called to do?” Little did I know that this question would have a two-part answer. \n', 'A magical stone that found me on Lucy Vincent Beach led to my writing a book, \n', 'founding an international non-profit organization, and then working with the is-\n', 'land community’s schools to bring the stories to life. We engaged community lead-\n', '431\n', 'ers and even a few celebrities to create educational events. When we were asked to \n', 'bring our Stone Soup magic to others, we worked with inner city communities like \n', 'Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, and Oakland – as well as national organizations \n', 'like the YMCA of the USA.\n', 'For over 20 years I’ve lived on islands, trying to finish this book.  I’ve trav-\n', 'eled to more than 60, from Martha’s Vineyard to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and then \n', 'island hopping through the Caribbean. And I’ve gone from the island state of \n', 'Hawaii to the island nation of the Philippines; and in Europe, to Croatia’s 1000 \n', 'islands, and then to Sri Lanka in Asia.  Each one of these has its own special \n', 'beauty, culture and peoples.\n', 'In today’s world, with the increasing dangers of climate change, island peo-\n', 'ple are now “the canaries in the coal mine.”  Every day they see their coastlines \n', 'eroding, their fish supply depleted, plastics littering their beaches, and toxic waste \n', 'and environmental hazards dumped into their pristine waters. On Vieques, after \n', 'Hurricane Maria, there was literally no food, no water, no gas, no ferry, and no \n', 'working ATMs. Along with the loss and pain, have come illness and death, and \n', 'sometimes apathy and despair. The limited availability of space on islands, and \n', 'the lack of affordable housing, access to living-wage jobs, government services, \n', 'and other key resources are threatening the investment these families have devot-\n', 'ed to their island for generations, just so they can survive. Many of them are being \n', 'forced to sell their lands in hopes of finding a better life. But where can they go?\n', 'Just before embarking on this island journey, I had led Healthy Community \n', 'Initiatives in Cleveland and Detroit. Consulting for business, government, edu-\n', 'cation, and community leaders, we built public-private partnerships to address \n', 'challenging local issues. It’s been shown statistically that communities with less \n', 'than 20,000 people have the greatest chance of success of this model. On island \n', 'communities, there is less than 1 degree of separation between the people. Ev-\n', 'eryone knows everyone—and knows everything! There is a natural cohesiveness: \n', 'people know their neighbors and tend to help each other out in a host of ways, \n', 'from building houses to caring for each other’s children. When someone is in trou-\n', 'ble, or a loved one passes, everyone offers to help, bring meals or lend a hand. By \n', 'luck or divine intervention, I discovered that islands, with their small populations, \n', 'were ideally suited to bringing the Stone Soup metaphor to life. This universally \n', 'known fable provided a simple and easy-to-understand way to get everyone to \n', 'work together to improve their communities, especially for their children. \n', 'Living and working alongside young people in these island communities for \n', '20 years was enlightening, humbling and a deep cultural learning experience. My \n', ' 432\n', 'life has been enriched by them and their simple ways of living—and their beauti-\n', 'ful beaches. But I have also witnessed the dark side of this paradise; the growing \n', 'inequities between the “haves” (tourists, developers) and the “have-nots” (locals). \n', 'It has been especially painful to see how little support there can be for young \n', 'people. Schools are ill-equipped to prepare young people for the 21st century. The \n', 'best and the brightest leave their homes for better education and greater opportu-\n', 'nities. And without experienced leaders, these island communities are increasingly \n', 'vulnerable to exploitation by those looking for a quick investment.\n', 'I have deep respect for island people; they are models of resilience, survival, \n', 'and resourcefulness. They live sustainably just to survive. At our first Summit on \n', 'Vieques, there was no running water for more than a month, except for those \n', 'who had a cistern in their backyard. One of our resourceful youth leaders led a \n', 'workshop on how to take a bath with a gallon of water.  When these young leaders \n', 'were invited to envision a sustainable future for their islands, they created a 2020 \n', 'Report for Sustainable Development. They courageously presented their 2020 \n', 'Reports to their leaders and communities.\n', 'Given that the young people on Vieques only spoke Spanish, they were ea-\n', 'ger to learn English from me. Since I’d not studied Spanish, we had to quickly \n', 'create a model that allowed local people to train each other.  It was then that we \n', 'adopted Dr. King’s motto, “Each one teach one” as our own.

100,Taynara Goncalves,A Multicultural Dreamer,434,438,"['A Multicultural Dreamer\n', 'Taynara Goncalves | Martha’s Vineyard\n', 'Ever since she was a little girl, Taynara dreamed of being a doctor. Growing \n', 'up, she and her family lived a simple life in the little village of Mantenópolis, Bra-\n', 'zil. As she walked past her grandmother’s house, she loved smelling the luscious \n', 'mangoes that she grew in big pots on her porch. “Everything we ate was organic \n', 'and seasonal,” she says. “When it was mango season, we ate mangoes. When it \n', 'was banana season, we ate bananas.”\n', 'However, with Brazil’s economy in tatters, there were few jobs. Life was \n', 'hard. Try as they might, it was tough for her parents to make ends meet. Often \n', 'Taynara’s family went without much food. For years, her parents saved every pen-\n', 'ny they could so they could search for a better life for their little family. And every \n', 'night they prayed together.\n', 'People in the village talked about the island of Martha’s Vineyard off the \n', 'coast of Massachusetts. A few local men had traveled the 5,000 miles there, and \n', 'found jobs building big homes for wealthy summer families. During the cold win-\n', 'ter months, they’d return home and work on building their own homes. Since \n', 'Taynara’s father was a carpenter, he was eager to see if he might find a good job \n', 'there too, so he could provide for his family.\n', 'In December 2001, they left Brazil with just a few things, filled with hope \n', 'for their future. As they boarded the plane, 3-year-old Taynara held her mother’s \n', 'hand and looked up at her. “Does this mean I’ll get to go to college and become \n', 'a doctor?” she asked. Her mother smiled and said, “This means a lot of things if \n', 'you are willing to try your hardest.”\n', 'When they arrived, they were one of the very first Brazilian families to live \n', 'on Martha’s Vineyard. Life wasn’t easy, especially in the winter. This little island \n', 'had a tight-knit community of 20,000 year-rounders. They struggled in the long \n', 'winter months to eke out a living. During the summer months, the island swelled \n', ' 434\n', 'to 100,000 people, including service workers from Ireland and Jamaica, who \n', 'worked in the hotels. Then, after the summer, everyone went home. So, when \n', 'Brazilians began to arrive with their whole families and to stay—and send their \n', 'children to school—local people were nervous. They didn’t think there would be \n', 'enough to go around, especially in the winter months. Taynara remembers how \n', 'it hurt when she saw how people looked down on her parents when they heard \n', 'their accents.\n', 'Taynara’s mother was relieved to discover that Elio Silva had opened a little \n', 'shop with Brazilian foods, including the chocolate Caixa de Bombons that her \n', 'father had bought her for special occasions. By the time twenty years had passed, \n', 'there were several restaurants catering to the more than 2,000 Brazilians who now \n', 'live year-round on the island. And Brazilian youth strengthened the high school’s \n', 'soccer team, which won the coveted statewide championships.\n', 'But on her first day of kindergarten at the Oak Bluffs School, Taynara could \n', 'feel everyone’s eyes on her. There was only one other Brazilian child in her class. \n', 'Taynara only knew four words in English: “Hi, how are you?” But with her warm \n', 'smile, sparkling eyes, and gentle ways, she made friends. She practiced her English \n', 'and picked up words watching movies on TV. To this day, Taynara greets every-\n', 'one with this same message—and with the same intention. She sincerely wants to \n', 'know how you are—which makes you want to respond in kind.\n', 'School wasn’t easy for Taynara, but she pushed herself, studied hard, and al-\n', 'ways got good grades. “I constantly reminded myself that this was my big chance \n', 'to achieve my dream,” she says. “Whenever I was discouraged I reminded myself \n', 'how lucky I was to be here and to have this opportunity.” In high school, she was \n', 'proud to be invited to join the National Honor Society. Step by step, with laser \n', 'focus, and along with her daily prayers, Taynara pursued her dream of becoming \n', 'a doctor.\n', 'Then one day her teacher nominated Taynara to be a youth delegate to the \n', 'Martha’s Vineyard Youth Leadership Initiative (MVYLI). When she arrived at \n', 'the orientation, she was surprised to see that the codirector of the Summit, Josue \n', 'Cruz, was from the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico. Josue had been just 14 years \n', 'old when he went to his first Summit in Vieques. Now in college, he was pursuing \n', 'his dream of becoming a lawyer. “It was amazing to listen to Josue; he had faced \n', 'struggles, but he wasn’t defined by them. He persevered,” Taynara says. “I knew \n', 'then that I wasn’t alone. That I can do this too!”\n', 'On the first day of the Summit, Taynara was fascinated to meet so many \n', 'multicultural young people from islands like Vieques, Virgin Gorda, and Hawaii. \n', '435\n', 'Taynara felt that she had a new family of friends who were all ready to support \n', 'her in realizing her goal. “It’s awesome!” she says. “It gives you another family, a \n', 'safe place to talk about important things—and to bring back to your school setting \n', 'too.”\n', 'At the Summit Taynara developed a greater awareness about climate change \n', 'and sustainability. On tours they took to the Vineyard farms, she saw different \n', 'crops than those she’d known in Brazil. She saw firsthand how climate change \n', 'was contributing to coastal erosion. Waterfront homes were being threatened, and \n', 'the frequent flooding of the Four Corners intersection by the ferry held up traffic \n', 'for hours.\n', 'A few years later, Taynara visited her family’s village in Brazil. “It was culture \n', 'shock,” she says. “Somehow it didn’t feel real. It’s a whole different world. Some-\n', 'times I wonder what my life would have been like if I’d stayed.” During that visit \n', 'she realized that climate change was taking a toll on her family’s village. Extreme \n', 'weather—first dryness from the lack of rain, and then torrential downpours—was \n', 'washing away the precious rich topsoil so important for farming their crops.\n', 'As the first in her family to go to college, Taynara was excited and nervous. \n', 'Her high school guidance counselor had discouraged Taynara from applying to a \n', 'four-year college. “That’s too much for you,” he said, and directed her instead to \n', 'a community college. But Taynara knew that she’d never become a doctor unless \n', 'she started at a four-year college. “I was a good student, involved with extracurric-\n', 'ular activities, just like the other students,” she says. “Why shouldn’t I be able to \n', 'pursue my dream?” She walked out the door, never to return. It was the first time \n', 'that she had felt the sting of institutional racism.\n', 'But in MVYLI’s college prep program, she got the help she needed: tutoring \n', 'for the SATs and help for her parents in filling out the financial aid forms. She \n', 'enjoyed visiting a few different colleges to see which one might be best for her. \n', 'However, as a “Dreamer” Taynara knew that she wouldn’t qualify for scholarships. \n', 'Her parents couldn’t help her either. Fortunately, the Institute found a benefactor \n', 'who offered to sponsor Taynara’s education. It was the answer to her prayers!\n', 'Taynara’s dream of becoming a doctor continued to be shaped with MVY-\n', 'LI’s Job Shadow Day. Each year she spent an afternoon with one of the island’s \n', 'doctors: she shadowed family physicians, pediatricians, doctors at the health clinic, \n', 'and eventually in the hospital’s emergency room. She loved it! Each time her \n', 'dream was renewed, even as she refined her goals. Thanks to her mentors, Tay-\n', 'nara was able to see the wealth of career opportunities for premed students, and \n', 'her horizons expanded.\n', ' 436\n', 'For her MVYLI Sustainability-in-Action project, Taynara worked with \n', 'other multicultural youth to envision and create the Institute’s Multicultural \n', 'Assembly at the Martha’s Vineyard Regional High School. “Hi, I’m Charlayne \n', 'Hunter-Gault, and I’m multicultural,” said the honored speaker when the day \n', 'came. “We are standing on the shoulders of giants,” she continued, quoting from \n', 'President Obama’s Inaugural speech. “I am, they were, you are where you are \n', 'because we are standing on the shoulders of giants.” Then high school senior \n', 'Jacob Lawrence spoke of his African American heritage, with roots in Ghana and \n', 'Nigeria. “Thirty percent of the MVRHS students are multicultural,” he told the \n', 'assembled students. “Take time to get to know your friends.” Then Ana Carvalho \n', 'shared her experience of being a Brazilian student at MVRHS in 2008. “When \n', 'I was a student, there was a lot of tension,” she admitted. Now a senior at Tufts \n', 'University, she invited the students to be open to each other. “I hope you will learn \n', 'to appreciate Brazilian culture. Your Brazilian peers have a lot to offer.”\n', 'For the next Summit Taynara served as a “Visioneer,” warmly welcoming \n', 'the new youth delegates as they arrived.

The anecdote Arun told had a very simple \n', 'message about sustainability embedded in it: it was about the importance of not \n', ' 438\n', 'throwing away a pencil until the very end.\n', 'It was the quality of the people Chris met at this week-long intensive Sum-\n', 'mit that touched him the most. He fondly remembers playing football on the large \n', 'lawn with Trevor and Elijah. This became the start of a very special friendship. \n', 'Chris was impressed that the Hawaiian delegates had collected native tea leaves \n', 'from their homeland to bring 6,000 miles to the Summit. As they taught him how \n', 'to make Hawaiian leis, they shared stories of their culture, their language, and \n', 'their world. Thanks to these young people and their aloha spirit, Chris came to \n', 'understand the concept of sustainability in a whole new light.\n', 'At that Summit, Arun Gandhi asked the Institute to bring its transformative \n', 'educational tools to the young people of India. Curious by nature, and a self-\n', 'taught techie, Chris offered to help with this ambitious challenge. He had already \n', 'won many awards, and had designed software and apps. While many of his class-\n', 'mates saw the technology career path as a ticket to a high-paying job, Chris was \n', 'more intrigued with the idea of being able to use the power of technology for \n', 'positive social change. His father, a longtime teacher at the Vineyard’s high school \n', 'had always encouraged his son to think outside the box. Now, empowered by what \n', 'he had learned at the Summit, Chris was inspired to ground his ideals in serving \n', 'humanity. He wasn’t quite sure how this was going to happen, but he was willing \n', 'to try.\n', 'That summer, while tourists and seasonal residents were vacationing, Chris \n', 'joined the Institute’s intergenerational team to dive into this very challenging task. \n', 'Their goal was to envision a way to transfer 20 years of the Institute’s trainings \n', 'and educational tools to an online platform. First Chris looked at digital courses \n', 'like Coursera and edX. “Too traditional,” he decided. Next the team decided \n', 'to use the Design Thinking approach, asking themselves the key question “How \n', 'might we?....” to brainstorm ideas. Then Chris had a thought—last summer he’d \n', 'attended a Hack-a-Thon, where college-aged students immersed themselves \n', 'for 24 hours to design innovative tech apps and software. “There’s never been a \n', 'Hack-a-Thon on the Vineyard,” Chris said. “Let’s do it!”\n', 'Chris thought it was a pretty simple idea. Little did he know what he was \n', 'about to embark on. Reaching out to college students and inviting them to give of \n', 'their time, and then travel all the way to the Vineyard by car, bus, and ferry took \n', 'some doing. But they came! They came from Amherst College, Hampshire Col-\n', 'lege, Mt. Holyoke College, and from the University of Massachusetts in Lowell. \n', 'Later they said that the idea of responding to Gandhi’s grandson’s challenge had \n', 'intrigued them.\n', '439\n', 'Finding a home large enough to house this crew was quite an undertaking. \n', 'It was now late November, and most large homes on the Vineyard aren’t insulated. \n', 'By luck, perseverance, and ultimately maybe even divine intervention, the owner \n', 'of a 20-room Victorian mansion, inspired by the Institute’s mission, offered her \n', 'home. Overlooking Inkwell Beach in Oak Bluffs, the Villa Rosa was once owned \n', 'by Joe Overton, a political organizer and the first head of a labor union in New \n', 'York City. His home had served as the Summer White House, and leaders and \n', 'organizers of the Civil Rights movement, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \n', 'had stayed here. It was here, looking out over the vast horizon of the Atlantic \n', 'Ocean, that Dr. King is said to have written his famous “I Have A Dream” speech.\n', 'The Design-A-Thon, as it was called, began with a sumptuous feast, with the \n', 'owner of the house sharing stories about its history. Then everyone jumped into \n', 'the immersive 24-hour experience. After the Institute’s team gave an overview of \n', 'their vision and goals, the visiting techies interviewed the Institute’s youth leaders \n', 'as well as the facilitators of the Summit to create a “user profile.” Then everyone \n', 'retired to their separate nooks to work on coding. They chose the attic as their hub, \n', 'and set up the large screen where they could showcase their progress. All through \n', 'the night they worked, sustained with lots of coffee, pizza, and junk food. It was \n', 'an exhilarating time. As the youngest person there, Chris loved hanging out with \n', 'these seasoned techies in the kitchen during their breaks and hearing them talk \n', 'about user-design, prototypes, beta testing, and the ultimate goal: user-friendly.\n', 'A videographer documented the process, and interviewed Chris and youth \n', 'leaders like Josue Cruz from Vieques, Puerto Rico and Alex Siordia from Hawaii. \n', '“This house is the right place to do this,” Chris said. “I feel that in some ways what \n', 'we are doing has a relation to what Dr. King was trying to do. Creating change \n', 'and inspiring people to challenge the status quo, and how to be leaders. You can \n', 'feel Dr. King’s presence here. That what you are doing has a bigger purpose than \n', 'just a computer program. I really feel that it can go somewhere.”\n', 'In just 24 hours, the band of techies had created an impressive “pitch deck” \n', 'presentation to present to potential funders. When it came time for the Reveal \n', 'Event, Chris made the presentation to the Island’s business and education leaders. \n', 'He was pretty proud of what everyone had accomplished. “It was a really good \n', 'feeling,” he says. “It was the first time I’d had the experience of having a big \n', 'idea, and helping to make it actually happen! To this very day, seven years later, \n', 'every time I drive by that house, I tell the story of this life-changing experience to \n', 'whomever is in the car.”\n', 'That fall, as a junior in high school, Chris convinced his advisor that he \n', ' 440\n', 'should get credit to pursue this project as an independent study. Then he joined \n', 'with the Institute’s facilitators, Gia Winsryg-Ulmer and Grace Burton Sundman, \n', 'to design a leadership course using the Institute’s curriculum. Offered to the Mar-\n', 'tha’s Vineyard Youth Leadership Initiative (MVYLI) youth, this 10-week pilot \n', 'program became the beta site for the Institute’s TouchStone Leaders Platform. “I \n', 'learned that it’s best to not sit back and overthink a great idea,” Chris says now. \n', '“If you have an idea that you think would make a difference in your life, your \n', 'community’s life, or anyone’s life, you should go through with it and act on it in \n', 'a timely manner.” Chris was convinced that his high school should incorporate \n', 'this pilot into their leadership class. “We should share it with others so they can \n', 'have an opportunity to learn the necessary leadership skills for life. This program \n', 'teaches many skills not found in the classroom.”\n', 'To continue his exploration into the tech world, Chris was matched with a \n', 'business leader, John Klein, for MVYLI’s Job Shadow Day. And the following year, \n', 'he was matched with virtual reality pioneer Galen Ho. As they explored Galen’s \n', 'state-of-the-art Immersive Worlds, Galen listened to Chris’s dreams for his future, \n', 'and encouraged him to apply to the little-known Olin College of Engineering, just \n', 'outside of Boston. When Chris received a full scholarship to study there, Chris’s \n', 'father was thrilled. He had attended Northeastern University, but had had to \n', 'drop out and get a job before he could complete his education. He knew what a \n', 'difference it would make for his son to graduate debt-free from college.\n', 'At the next Summit, Chris was a freshman at Olin College of Engineering. \n', 'He was thrilled to see Trevor again, who was now a senior in college. Chris espe-\n', 'cially enjoyed rooming with Trevor and sharing lodgings with the younger male \n', 'delegates at the Summit. “They were so full of energy, so funny, and eager to hear \n', 'about my experiences at college,” Chris says. “I was happy to be able to be a true \n', 'mentor to these high school youth. It was a good feeling.”\n', 'For the past few years Trevor had worked with the Institute to design strate-\n', 'gies to bring sustainability education to public school students. He was also search-\n', 'ing for ways to use technology to help youth get jobs in the emerging field of \n', 'sustainability. Chris was happy to help Trevor with this new challenge. Along with \n', 'the Institute’s tech advisor, Chris and Trevor once again dived into the question \n', '“How might we...?” “Let’s create a new site,” Chris said. He quickly searched \n', 'for available ones. “Sustainability is Fun is available,” he said, “Shall we grab it? \n', 'What a great name - kids will love it!”\n', 'Throughout the following year, Chris worked virtually with Trevor and the \n', 'Institute’s team to create the new site so that it could be tested with youth at the \n', '441\n', 'next Summit. Then he brought his college roommate, Ilya, to the next summit, \n', 'which was held in Newport, Rhode Island. With Trevor as their guide, they en-\n', 'visioned an online ecosystem that connects youth, educators, and companies to \n', 'build sustainable economies.\n', 'They’d also made plans to create a Design-A-Thon to be held just before the \n', 'Summit. This time it was with business, education, and government leaders of the \n', 'Blue Economy in southern New England.\n', 'They designed surveys, gathered data, and facilitated an engaging user-de-\n', 'sign experience with these industry leaders. With Trevor as their guide for the \n', 'week-long event, they drilled down on the data and designed a presentation for \n', 'the Summit about the Sustainable Workforce Development Network: Sustain-\n', 'WDNTM.\n', '“It was truly a pleasure to meet our next generation of leaders at the De-\n', 'sign-A-Thon,” says Robert Rak, of Bristol Community College’s Blue Center. “It \n', 'was inspiring to see these young people actively engaging in the development of \n', 'meaningful communication with business leaders. They were not only seeking \n', 'information for themselves, but also for the youth of today as a whole. Bringing \n', 'together the many players in this emerging Blue Economy is very important so \n', 'that we can work together, as a team, to bring a bright future to our region and \n', 'the nation as a whole.”\n', 'Just before Chris graduated from college, his beloved father passed.

Little did he know how \n', 'prophetic this would be when in 2017 Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico. \n', 'Vieques was at the eye of that storm.\n', 'Josue continued his travels, next to Los Angeles. At the next Youth Lead-\n', 'ership Summit on Vieques, he had met the grandson and namesake of the great \n', 'Latino leader, Cesar Chavez. He’d read about his leadership for the farmworkers \n', 'in California. Josue was happy to translate for Cesar and bring his inspiring mes-\n', '449\n', 'sage of hope to Vieques youth. So, when Cesar invited Josue to visit him in Los \n', 'Angeles, he jumped at the chance. Within a few short months, he visited Cesar \n', 'Chavez’s burial place, La Paz and his Radio Campesina, where he was a featured \n', 'guest speaker. Cesar taught Josue how to create a website to share VYLI’s message \n', 'with the world. Upon his return, Josue created his own radio show, where he \n', 'featured local experts to share their vision for Vieques’s future.\n', 'Everyone on Vieques longed to see the world. So, when Josue returned from \n', 'Los Angeles, he was famous. When asked for his advice, Josue would always en-\n', 'courage young people to stay in school, get good grades, and make something of \n', 'their lives. He humbled himself by sharing that once he was a C-D student and \n', 'now he had a 4.0.\n', 'Next Josue led his people on a mission to ask the government to help. Jos-\n', 'ue boarded a plane with 42 youth and parents from Vieques to fly to San Juan. \n', 'Dressed in their VYLI T-shirts, everyone stood proudly in front of La Fortaleza, \n', 'the Governor’s mansion, with their friend Tito Auger. Inside Josue gave an impas-\n', 'sioned speech demanding action from government officials. From that moment \n', 'on, everyone knew this young man was destined for greatness.\n', 'Next Josue traveled with the Mayor’s Economic Development team to Tor-\n', 'tola to study how the small business model in the British Virgin Islands supported \n', 'local companies instead of investing in the economic trap of the supermalls in \n', 'San Juan. Since Josue was now fluent in English, he was asked to make the pre-\n', 'sentation on behalf of the Mayor to the BVI Prime Minister. The Prime Minister \n', 'was so impressed he asked the Institute to bring the VYLI model to his country \n', 'to inspire BVI’s youth. Josue’s friends from the Cultural Arts & Entrepreneurship \n', 'Initiative joined him at the Caribbean Artisan Festival. As the youngest artisan/\n', 'entrepreneurs to showcase their wares, they were fascinated by the eco-foresters \n', 'from Trinidad and Tobago who grew trees and harvested the seeds to make exqui-\n', 'site jewelry. From the $4,000 they earned during the winter, they paid for their trip.\n', 'Josue continued his mission as an ambassador for Vieques youth, joining \n', 'Mayor of Vieques to meet with Puerto Rico’s First Lady, then speaking at events \n', 'in New York City and Washington, DC Later, Boston’s first Puerto Rican City \n', 'Councilman, Felix Arroyo, hosted an event celebrating the anniversary of Vi-\n', 'eques’s freedom from the U.S. Navy. Josue had become an impressive orator. \n', 'When he received the Institute’s first Walter Cronkite Award, he said, “Walter \n', 'Cronkite is an icon of the highest standard of democracy and equality. Being \n', 'the Walter Cronkite award winner was a door opening experience for me. I feel \n', 'a responsibility to carry on the legacy of a man who represents responsible and \n', ' 450\n', 'human journalism.”\n', 'Soon Josue was featured in prominent publications like Caribbean Business \n', 'and the Vineyard Gazette. People started asking Josue to be the mayor of their island. \n', 'He reminded them that he first needed to finish his education and realize his \n', 'dream of becoming a lawyer. For now, he was proud to be a 4.0 college student on \n', 'a full scholarship. As a law student, he was the only one from a family on welfare. \n', 'At his graduation he received a prestigious honor for his contribution to the people \n', 'of Vieques.\n', 'Then in 2010 Josue traveled to Martha’s Vineyard to serve on the faculty \n', 'of the Institute’s 6th Summit. There he met youth leaders from other Caribbean \n', 'islands of Bahamas, Jamaica, Barbados and from the newly formed Virgin Gorda \n', 'Youth Leadership Initiative. For his presentation on Vieques he shared his dreams \n', 'for his island community. Josue loved visiting the Vineyard, which is the same \n', 'shape and size as Vieques. He especially enjoyed learning about innovative proj-\n', 'ects he saw on the Sustainability Tours. When he visited the school’s gardens and \n', 'heard Noli Taylor’s presentation on the Island Grown Schools Initiative, a light \n', 'went on. “If they can feed their people - with just a five-month growing season, \n', 'just imagine what we could do in Puerto Rico!” he exclaimed.\n', 'Upon his return, Josue embarked on his action plan. He researched and \n', 'wrote a grant to get federal funds for school gardens. He even worked with the op-\n', 'posing political party to get both sides to work for the good of their people. Josue \n', 'is proud of the 100 school gardens they built, especially the one for handicapped \n', 'students who now have a path towards self-sufficiency, selling their produce at \n', 'the Farmer’s Market. Unfortunately, Josue also learned about the underbelly of \n', 'politics. When the press conference was held and awards were presented, Josue \n', 'wasn’t invited to the stage. While he was the one who did all the hard work, the \n', 'credit went to those from the other party. Nonetheless, Josue was proud of his ac-\n', 'complishments. The second year the grant doubled, as did the number of school \n', 'gardens. In his heart, he knew his people had the tools to feed themselves and \n', 'become self-sufficient; that was reward enough.\n', 'Josue’s next journey led him to Hawaii - 7,000 miles from his home. On the \n', 'Big Island, he swam with the dolphins, witnessed the active volcano, and reveled in \n', 'the snowcapped mountains of Mauna Lea. On the Institute’s Sustainability Tours \n', 'he learned about renewable energy projects like Hawaii Pacific Academy’s Energy \n', 'Lab. At the Waimea Elementary School garden, Josue shared his experiences in \n', 'Puerto Rico and learned new tips for organic gardening. His favorite memory is \n', 'of spending an afternoon with Nancy Redfeather in her luscious gardens. Nan-\n', '451\n', 'cy was Noli Taylor’s mentor when she first studied school gardens. Nancy was \n', 'touched that her mentee had inspired Josue to follow in her footsteps. In return, \n', 'Josue was happy to share his connections so Nancy could receive grants to support \n', 'Hawaii’s State School Garden Initiative.\n', 'After Josue’s classmates passed the Bar, they took high paying jobs and \n', 'climbed career ladders that guaranteed them a comfortable life. With his newly \n', 'minted law degree, Josue decided to first help his people get titles to their land. \n', 'People had lost their land when the Navy confiscated and razed their homes to \n', 'build new ones for its officers. Josue was Vieques’s first lawyer who could now \n', 'represent them. It was a long, arduous process. Gathering all the legal documents \n', 'to prove their ownership, then representing his people at the government’s offices \n', 'in San Juan was challenging. Josue spent many days there pleading their cases. For \n', 'him it was just the right thing to do.\n', 'Josue then traveled to Texas to join his friend Carmianne, who invited him \n', 'to join a law firm. For a while, he tried it out, but didn’t like what he saw there. \n', 'He was furious that Spanish speaking people were being robbed by some of the \n', 'lawyers, who promised to get them U.S. citizenship. So, he explored other options \n', 'before deciding to create his own firm. He put out a shingle and used social media \n', 'to post videos showing how he was an honest person with integrity. People started \n', 'coming. Word got out. People who had lived, worked, and paid taxes in the U.S. \n', 'for 10, 20, or more years were being deported. Josue was outraged. While he had \n', 'never liked going to court during his law school days, he now felt a passion to help \n', 'these people.\n', 'Then the Border Wall fiasco began. People from Central America affected \n', 'by U.S. wars and climate change were desperate.

They were well-educated, \n', '453\n', 'they found good jobs, and became leaders of their church and in their community. \n', 'They made a good life for their family, living in a modest middle-class home next \n', 'to Handsome Bay. Feliza loved walking on the beach with her father, collecting \n', 'colorful conch shells and watching sea creatures scurrying across the sand.\n', 'Feliza’s parents had instilled in her the importance of getting a good educa-\n', 'tion. Always planning ahead, they made sure she had dual citizenship. While she \n', 'was in labor, Feliza’s mother journeyed by ferry to the hospital in the U.S. Virgin \n', 'Islands capitol of St. Thomas to give birth there, so that one day her little girl \n', 'would have the option to attend university in the United States.\n', 'The British Virgin Islands are a gateway for all British-owned Caribbean \n', 'islands. It is a stepping stone “across the pond” for those who aspire to go to \n', 'university and pursue a professional life in the islands’ mother country of the \n', 'United Kingdom. Feliza grew up with children from Dominica, Jamaica, Guyana, \n', 'Antigua, Barbuda, and the British West Indies who made up the diverse Virgin \n', 'Gorda community of 4,000 people. In Virgin Gorda, everyone knows everyone \n', 'else. Feliza had seen how the less well-educated parents of some of her classmates \n', 'travelled to work from their homes in tin-roofed shacks on primitive scooters, \n', 'wearing the crisp uniforms required for their jobs serving tourists.\n', 'From an early age, Feliza wanted to find a way to help more young people \n', 'strive for a better future. She was troubled by what she saw around her—the vast \n', 'inequity of wealth, and the lack of opportunities for local children. So, when \n', 'she was 16 and she heard about a new youth leadership program that was going \n', 'to be offered on Virgin Gorda, she jumped at the chance. She was fascinated \n', 'to learn about how young people on the nearby island of Vieques, Puerto Rico \n', 'had created the Stone Soup Leadership Institute’s first Sustainability Summit and, \n', 'following that, the Vieques Youth Leadership Initiative. “If they can do it, so can \n', 'we!” she thought.\n', 'She invited some of her friends to join her for a meeting at the Road Town \n', 'Café, where the Institute’s team started the meeting with a question for them: \n', '“What is your dream for your life, for your island, and for the world?” she said. She \n', 'loved hearing her friends share their dreams with each other. “Just imagine if we \n', 'could make them happen!” she said.\n', 'Feliza has always had a gift for communication, and for bringing people \n', 'together. She was eager to share her friends’ dreams with adults, especially with \n', 'the government leaders on BVI’s capitol island of Tortola, who she felt could be \n', 'more supportive of too-often-marginalized Virgin Gorda youth. In order to be \n', 'taken seriously, Feliza decided that first her group needed a name and a mission \n', ' 454\n', 'statement; then they could ask for letters of support from community leaders. And \n', 'that is how the Virgin Gorda Youth Leadership Initiative (VGYLI) was born.\n', 'Feliza was happy that at the VGYLI meetings, the Institute’s team actually \n', 'listened to young people, and asked them what was important to them. Too often \n', 'in patriarchal societies, children are expected to be “seen and not heard.” But \n', 'VGYLI youth had some good ideas for how their community could be better, and \n', 'now they had a chance to put their ideas into action by organizing community \n', 'service projects.\n', 'Feliza began to imagine herself as a TV journalist, and decided she wanted \n', 'to create a VGYLI video. She thought it would be a good way to get the message \n', 'across. So she found a filmmaker, picked out background music, decided on a \n', 'location, created a script, rehearsed her voiceover message, and then cajoled her \n', 'friends into sharing their dreams on camera. And she invited local business leaders, \n', 'like the Bitter End Yacht Club owner, Dana Hokin, to talk about the importance \n', 'of training and hiring young people to work in the tourist industry on camera too.\n', 'When the film was finished, it was a hit! Everyone loved it.\n', 'At one of their meetings, VGYLI youth watched an eye-opening movie by \n', 'former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, An Inconvenient Truth. Everyone was shocked to \n', 'discover just how vulnerable their island—and our whole planet—really are to cli-\n', 'mate change. They began talking among themselves, seeing things differently, and \n', 'putting two and two together. They began thinking about why it was, for example, \n', 'that it was always 10 degrees hotter on Virgin Gorda than on the neighboring \n', 'islands. They could see that their daily lives were already being affected by climate \n', 'change. For example, with very little rainfall, Virgin Gorda had had to create the \n', 'first desalination plant in the BVI, just so everyone could have enough drinking \n', 'water. And because it has very few trees to serve as a coastal barrier, their island \n', 'was very vulnerable to hurricanes.\n', 'Feliza was concerned. Now that she’d seen the “inconvenient” truth, she \n', 'wanted everyone else to see it too. She knew that nothing would change until \n', 'people got together to make a change. She created a survey and shared it with her \n', 'community—asking people if they’d heard of climate change and if they knew \n', 'what was happening to their environment. She was even more worried when she \n', 'found that of the 80 people she surveyed, only a few had even heard of climate \n', 'change. So she wrote a report and featured it on VGYLI’s website. “While the \n', 'truth is inconvenient, we must each do our part,” she said. “Before you throw that \n', 'soda can in the road, think twice. We can be a shining example.”\n', 'Once they’d seen the movie, VGYLI youth were curious to learn more about \n', '455\n', 'their island. Thanks to a generous charter boat owner, they had the opportunity \n', 'of a lifetime when he invited them to go on an Environmental Stewards Sustain-\n', 'ability Tour. Like most Caribbean youth, they didn’t even know how to swim! And \n', 'they’d never been snorkeling. The experience was incredibly exciting for them. \n', '“When I jumped off the boat, I had to overcome my fears of heights - and be ad-\n', 'venturous,” one of them said. Another said, “I was so scared, but then I realized, I \n', 'can do it! And then I had fun.” These future youth leaders were thrilled to see all \n', 'the magical creatures who lived under the sea—right in their very own backyard! \n', 'So this is why all the tourists come to visit! they realized.\n', 'During the trip, the captain shared with the young people the harsh real-\n', 'ity of how these precious coral reefs were dying from uneducated boaters who \n', 'had anchorage habits. To make things worse, in 2005, rising sea temperatures \n', 'had bleached the coral reefs. This experience left a lasting impression on Feli-\n', 'za. “Knowledge is power,” she thought. And then, “Knowing, seeing, believing \n', '– knowing is seeing, and seeing is believing!”\n', 'Eager to learn more, in 2007 the VGYLI youth created the first Sustain-\n', 'ability Summit to be held on Virgin Gorda. Hosted by the Bitter End Yacht Club, \n', 'Virgin Gorda youth learned from the Vieques youth leaders who shared their \n', 'sustainability initiatives, as well as local business leaders, who challenged them to \n', 'study hard and pursue their dreams.\n', 'Feliza’s next adventure was to travel to St. Lucia to be a youth delegate \n', 'at the Caribbean Media Exchange (CMEx) Conference on Sustainable Tourism. \n', 'There she learned from government leaders about innovative sustainability prac-\n', 'tices that were being introduced on neighboring islands. And, emboldened by the \n', 'enthusiasm that her video had met with so far, she presented it at the next CMEx \n', 'Conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n', 'Upon graduation from high school, Feliza decided to go to college in the \n', 'United States at Texas Christian University to study journalism. Whenever she \n', 'went home for a visit, everyone looked to her for leadership, and she always en-\n', 'couraged them to do better with their lives. And while many of the BVI’s best \n', 'and brightest leave for college and then stay away, where there are more career \n', 'opportunities, Feliza was determined to return to Virgin Gorda after graduating \n', 'from college.\n', 'Putting her communications skills to work, she began as an information offi-\n', 'cer at the BVI’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Labour.

The Handsome Bay beach near Feliza’s fami-\n', ' 456\n', 'ly home was covered with it! She wrote a report on the sargassum invasion for the \n', 'BVI Conservation and Fisheries Department, and harkening back to her earlier \n', 'years, she also took a lead role in preparing a report assessing BVI’s ability to cope \n', 'with a mass casualty event.

He had grown up on his family’s \n', 'farms, where the rich soil from volcanic ash produced fruit trees, taro and green \n', 'vegetables, and Kona coffee. Trevor was instilled with a deep respect for ‘aina—\n', 'the land. Working with his family in the gardens was his kokua, his responsibility. \n', 'In school, he’d learned Hawaiian chants to bless the land, and to protect the food \n', 'and waters.

However, after he had turned it in, the \n', 'question stayed with him. He knew his friends at private schools had had courses \n', 'in sustainability. “Everyone should learn about it,” he thought.\n', 'As an officer of the student council, Trevor was invited to create a resolution. \n', 'Thus, began what Trevor calls his “sustainability journey.” The Sustainability \n', 'Resolution he wrote would require every public- school student in Hawaii to take \n', 'one course on sustainability. When he introduced it, people cautioned him not \n', 'to get his hopes up. Others, much more knowledgeable and experienced than he, \n', 'had tried for years to introduce such a measure, and had failed. But Trevor was \n', 'determined. He thought it was only right that all of Hawaii’s young people should \n', 'learn about how to live sustainably.\n', 'When he was 16 years old, a local farmer and champion of school gardens, \n', 'Nancy Redfeather, nominated Trevor to serve as a youth delegate to the Stone \n', 'Soup Leadership Institute’s Youth Leadership Summit for Sustainable Develop-\n', 'ment.

At his first Summit, when he \n', '459\n', 'was 14 years old, Josue had asked himself some simple questions: What is my dream \n', 'for my life, for my island, and for my community? Since then, Josue had gone from being a \n', 'mediocre high school student to being a 4.0, full scholarship college student, who \n', 'was now heading to law school.\n', 'Trevor had never thought about having a Five-Year Plan. As a basketball \n', 'star who aimed for the state championships, he knew the importance of hard \n', 'work and discipline in achieving goals.

So, when it was time for him to create \n', 'his Five-Year Plan, he had to stretch himself: but Josue’s reassurance, support. \n', 'and confidence in him made all the difference. Josue asked him some challenging \n', 'questions, which helped him expand his idea of what was possible. Trevor started \n', 'to see how he could make his dreams come true - and how he could make the \n', 'Sustainability Resolution happen.\n', 'He returned to Hawaii with greater focus, and strengthened energy for the \n', 'journey ahead. As a founding member of the Institute’s Sustainable Hawaii Youth \n', 'Leadership Initiative, Trevor now put into practice what he’d learned at the Sum-\n', 'mit.

He knew that he’d have to learn how the government worked in order \n', 'to make the Sustainability Resolution a reality, so he was grateful when his state \n', 'representative, Denny Kaufman, agreed to meet with him. Rep. Kaufman asked \n', 'his aide, Nicole Lowen, to help Trevor write the Sustainability Resolution, and \n', 'agreed to sponsor it in the House.\n', 'Next Trevor needed to find a champion in the State Senate. Through the \n', 'Institute, he met Ian Kitajima, a seasoned business leader who took Trevor under \n', 'his wing. Trevor flew to the state capitol in Honolulu and walked the halls of \n', 'power with Ian.

He reached out to friends and community leaders and asked them \n', 'to write testimonials. Step by step, he built the momentum they needed. Then \n', 'he traveled back to Honolulu to present his resolution in the Senate chambers. \n', 'They were impressed with Trevor’s passion and vision. After just six months, the \n', 'resolution passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate.\n', 'Everyone was amazed at Trevor’s accomplishment. The press made him \n', 'a local hero. His Sustainability Resolution became his capstone project for his \n', 'senior year. And, as icing on the cake, Trevor graduated as valedictorian of his \n', 'high school class, and his team won the state championship that year.\n', ' 460\n', 'Then came the hard part - making the resolution a reality. For the next few \n', 'years, Trevor pursued his college education. He worked with the Institute’s team \n', 'to organize forums with Hawaiian youth, educators, and leaders of business and \n', 'government. Using “Design Thinking” language, he explored how to implement \n', 'the Sustainability Resolution. The biggest challenge was that it would cost the \n', 'schools money to adopt a new course, and Hawaii’s Department of Education \n', 'just didn’t have the resources. They were woefully underfunded. Teachers were \n', 'underpaid. There was just no money to add new courses, nor were there funds \n', 'available to train teachers, or develop state standards.\n', 'Then in 2014, Hawaii’s Governor Ike took a bold stand: he declared that \n', 'Hawaii would have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. By now Nicole Lowen \n', 'was Trevor’s new state representative, and she chaired the powerful Grants in Aid \n', 'budget. She worked with Trevor and the Institute to get a grant in partnership \n', 'with Design Thinking Hawaii. Trevor created a simple survey to engage local \n', 'youth and educators, as well as business and community leaders, to determine \n', 'what was most important to Hawaiians. He integrated the UN’s Sustainable De-\n', 'velopment Goals with Hawaii’s sustainability goals, and found that for Hawaiians, \n', 'food scarcity and the cost of electricity were the top issues. Through the surveys, \n', 'Trevor learned that companies were having trouble hiring people who had only a \n', '5th grade level of math proficiency to monitor their water meters. He researched \n', 'all the best programs in Hawaii, and worked with the tech team to design an \n', 'online resource – the Sustainable Hawaii Toolkit.\n', 'At the Institute’s 2018 Summit, Trevor presented the toolkit to youth dele-\n', 'gates from all over New England. He’d discovered it was especially challenging to \n', 'find information on local green jobs. Now a college junior, he was eager to find out \n', 'how he and others could get jobs in the emerging field of sustainability. He shared \n', 'his frustration with the Institute’s tech team. All week, Trevor and Chris Aring, a \n', 'fellow Summit alumnus, grappled with this question. They decided to expand \n', 'from focusing on just Hawaii to include other states: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, \n', 'Puerto Rico, and California. They created an online tool, “Sustainability is Fun,” \n', 'that featured all the best sustainability resources, including games and interactive \n', 'learning opportunities, as well listings of green jobs. They beta tested their pro-\n', 'totype with the Summit delegates, and got ideas for how to make it even better. \n', 'At the Summit graduation, Trevor was recognized with letters from a number \n', 'of state and local leaders of government, including Hawaii’s governor. One was \n', 'from Rep. Nicole Lowen, who wrote:\n', 'Trevor Tanaka, a Konawaena High School graduate, is a beacon of excellence, in-\n', '461\n', 'spiring those around him with his commitment to creating a healthier, more sustain-\n', 'able planet. Even though some challenges may seem insurmountable, the Hawaiian \n', 'proverb ‘A‘ohe hana nui ke alu ‘ia (No task is too big when done together by all), \n', 'reminds us that we can accomplish much with dialogue and collaboration.\n', 'Then Trevor learned about the Blue Economy Corridor initiative in New \n', 'England. At the Institute’s 2019 Summit, he and Chris Aring created a Design-\n', 'A-Thon, working with representatives of the Corridor, and Trevor designed a \n', 'survey to drill down into the issues they were facing. While there were pockets of \n', 'innovation happening, there wasn’t a plan for how to build bridges between youth, \n', 'schools, and companies so that the economy in underserved communities could \n', 'thrive. So, Trevor and the team envisioned a Sustainable Workforce Development \n', 'Network—an online ecosystem that connects youth, educators, and companies to \n', 'build sustainable economies.\n', 'As Trevor continues his journey by pursuing an MBA in business, he has \n', 'been working with the Institute’s tech team to build a beta site to test at the Insti-\n', 'tute’s 2020 Summit. “Step by step we can build our dreams for our islands, and \n', 'for our world,” he says.\n', 'Change will not come if we wait \n', 'for some other person or some other time.\n', 'We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. \n', 'We are the change that we seek.\n', 'President Barack Obama\n', 'Call to Action\n', 'To learn more about opportunities to learn & build a sustainable world visit: \n', 'Sustainable Hawaii Toolkit: www. sustainhawaiitoolkit.com \n', 'SustainabilityisFun.com \n', 'SustainWDN.com'""]","['Aring, Chris', 'blue economy', 'Design-A-Thon', 'Design Thinking', 'Hawaii sustainability education', 'islands sustainability resources', 'jobs in sustainability field', 'Obama, Barack', 'Redfeather, Nancy', 'Stone Soup Leadership Institute Sustainable Hawaii Youth Leadership Initiative', 'Stone Soup Leadership Institute Youth Leadership Summit for Sustainable Development', 'Sustainability is Fun', 'Sustainability Resolution', 'Sustainable Hawaii Toolkit', 'Tanaka, Trevor', 'technology for activism sustainability resources']"
